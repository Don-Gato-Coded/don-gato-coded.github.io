<p>Who, Me? Well, would you look at the calendar? Itâ€™s Monday already, and by lunchtime any fond memories of the weekend will have been erased by work worries of the sort <em>The Register</em> celebrates each week in â€œWho, Me?â€ â€“ the reader-contributed column that tells your stories of making messes and somehow escaping.</p>

<p>This week, meet a reader weâ€™ll Regomize as â€œAlejandroâ€ who told us he once worked for a major multinational company and in the early 1990s was trained to perform a mainframe migration project. The plan was to bring a payroll app into the late 20th century by moving from a 1970s-vintage IBM box to a new NCR machine that ran Unix.</p>
