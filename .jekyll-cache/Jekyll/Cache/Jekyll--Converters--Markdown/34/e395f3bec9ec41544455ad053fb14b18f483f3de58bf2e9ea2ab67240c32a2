<p>Founded in 2008 in Madrid, Bertone Studio is powered by the creativity of Eduardo Bertone and Michiyo Sato. Their collaboration has led to the studio's unique illustration and animation style, which has been labelled psychedelic folk art but really entails so much more.</p>

<p>Stunning in terms of both colour and detail, the looping animations Michiyo and Eduardo create aren't just loopy â€“ the work is a labour of love, the result of a dedication to the craft of animation. Every frame and every detail is carefully considered and drawn by hand, and the results are dazzling. Whether it's a self-initiated project released on social media or animation created for a major commercial campaign, the animation doesn't get much more mesmerizing.</p>
