I"<p><strong>Robert Dennis Crumb</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English" title="Help:IPA/English">/ k r ʌ m /</a>; born August 30, 1943) is an American artist who often signs his work <strong>R. Crumb</strong>. His work displays a nostalgia for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore_of_the_United_States" title="Folklore of the United States">American folk culture</a> of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and satire of contemporary American culture.</p>

<p>Crumb contributed to many of the seminal works of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_comix" title="Underground comix">underground comix</a> movement in the 1960s, including being a founder of the first successful underground comix publication, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zap_Comix" title="Zap Comix">Zap Comix</a></em>, contributing to all 16 issues. He was additionally contributing to the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Village_Other" title="East Village Other">East Village Other</a></em> and many other publications, including a variety of one-off and anthology comics. During this time, inspired by psychedelics and cartoons from the 1920s and 1930s, he introduced a wide variety of characters that became extremely popular, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s" title="Counterculture of the 1960s">countercultural</a> icons <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_the_Cat" title="Fritz the Cat">Fritz the Cat</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Natural_\(comics\)" title="Mr. Natural (comics)">Mr. Natural</a>, and the images from his <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_On_Truckin%27_\(comics\)" title="Keep On Truckin' (comics)">Keep On Truckin'</a></em> strip. Sexual themes abounded in all these projects, often shading into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatology" title="Scatology">scatological</a> and pornographic comics. In the mid-1970s, he contributed to the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_\(comics_magazine\)" title="Arcade (comics magazine)">Arcade</a></em> anthology; following the decline of the underground, he moved towards biographical and autobiographical subjects while refining his drawing style, a heavily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatching" title="Hatching">crosshatched</a> pen-and-ink style inspired by late 19th- and early 20th-century cartooning. Much of his work appeared in a magazine he founded, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weirdo_\(comics\)" title="Weirdo (comics)">Weirdo</a></em> (1981–1993), which was one of the most prominent publications of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_comics" title="Alternative comics">alternative comics</a> era. As his career progressed, his comic work became more autobiographical.</p>
