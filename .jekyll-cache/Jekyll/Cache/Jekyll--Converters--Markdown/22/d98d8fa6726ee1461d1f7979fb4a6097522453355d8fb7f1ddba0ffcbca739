<p><a href="https://consequence.net/artist/spiritbox/">Spiritbox</a> hit the stage at on Monday (July 7th) for a performance of their song â€œSoft Spineâ€ in their late-night television debut.</p>

<p>After an introduction from guest host Anthony Anderson, the camera cut to black-and-white for the absolutely crushing rendition of the track, which hails from the Canadian metal bandâ€™s 2025 album <em><a href="https://consequence.net/2024/11/spiritbox-new-album-tsunami-sea-perfect-soul/">Tsunami Sea</a></em> â€”Â one of the <a href="https://consequence.net/list/best-metal-albums-hard-rock-of-2025-so-far/">top heavy albums of 2025 so far</a>.</p>

<p>While the group has plenty of melodic material that would have slotted it smoothly with the late-night format, Spiritbox boldly opted for one of their most aggro songs â€” a three-minute pounder with nu-metal riffs and fiery vocals from frontwoman Courtney LaPlante. Any unaware network TV viewers were certainly in for a shock.</p>
