<p>In August 2019, the New York film-maker Eva Aridjis Fuentes embarked on a cab ride that would change her life. Though her driver sported sunglasses and a turban, Aridjis Fuentes thought she looked eerily familiar. â€œTheÂ driver played Neil Youngâ€™s Harvest album in its entirety; we sang Heart of Gold together. I asked if sheâ€™d ever seen Neil play. She said: â€˜Oh no, my concert days are long overâ€™. So then I asked if sheâ€™d ever seen Q Lazzarus.â€</p>
