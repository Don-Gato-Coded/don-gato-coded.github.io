  <p><em>Singles</em> is often seen as a <em>sui generis</em> rock-historical document because of its ostensible realism. Croweâ€™s love letter to his adopted hometownâ€”shot on site and cast with actual localsâ€”was composed in the moments before Seattle became a synecdoche for rockâ€™s latest rebirth, and was rush-released to coincide with a moment that it, in turn, further fueled. Twenty-five years later, when local scenes are inextricable from their immediate online hype and a churn of thinkpieces mourn rockâ€™s latest â€œdeath,â€ <em>Singles</em> feels less like Hollywood realism and more like the conjured ghost of a dead moment. As in the early 1990s, so it is today: rock lies in wait, ready for its resurrection through some authentic commercial sÃ©ance. Maybe Cornell knew best, growling on the <em>Singles</em> soundtrack: â€œThe snake retreats/Admits defeat/And waits for the birth ritual.â€</p>
