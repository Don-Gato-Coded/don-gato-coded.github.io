I"ê<p>Not really as busy with Beeminder this week! I've mostly been really busy with my new Jekyll digital garden project (which you can preview <a href="https://enjoymentwork.netlify.app">here</a> if you're curious). It's crazy how many useful rabbit holes I've gone down in research, and with the serendipitous benefit of having the project's purpose be to archive and organize such rabbit holes!</p>
