<p>Itâ€™s not a kiss, but itâ€™s not <em>not</em> a kiss. Her lipsâ€”full, soft, pliableâ€”yield under mine, warm from the electric heating rod embedded in her throat. They taste of a faint chemical, like aspartame in Diet Pepsi. Her thermoplastic elastomer skin is sensitive to fabric dyes, so she wears white Agent Provocateur lingerie on white Ralph Lauren sateen sheets. Iâ€™ve prepped her body with EstÃ©e Lauder talcum, a detail I take pride in, to mimic the dry elasticity of real flesh. Her breathing quickensâ€”a quiet pulse courtesy of Dyson Air technology. Beneath the TPE skin, her Boston Dynamics joint system gyrates softly. Sheâ€™s in silent mode, so when I kiss her neck, her moan streams directly into my Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones.</p>
