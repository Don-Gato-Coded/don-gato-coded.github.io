The Detroit Pistons, a team with a rich history, was founded in 1937 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, as the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons. They turned professional in 1941, winning two NBL championships in 1944 and 1945 before joining the BAA in 1948, which later became the NBA. The team relocated to Detroit in 1957. The "Bad Boys" era in the late 1980s, led by Isiah Thomas, brought back-to-back NBA championships in 1989 and 1990. The Pistons won another NBA championship in 2004, marking another successful era for the team.
