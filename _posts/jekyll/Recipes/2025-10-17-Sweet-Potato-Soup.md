This Lentil Soup with Sweet Potato is so comforting, nutritious, hearty and 100% plant-based. It’s the type of soup that’s perfect for cooler weather, but that also makes sense to eat year-round.

My version is very vegetable-forward and chunky, with loads of protein and nutrition from all of the beans and veggies, including lentils, sweet potatoes, kale, carrots, celery, onions and tomato. And Spanish smoked paprika along with Eastern Mediterranean warming spices of cumin and coriander add such beautiful flavor, aroma and savoriness!

Lentils are one of those perfect foods, in my humble opinion. Filled with protein and nutrition, they are so satisfying, versatile and easy to cook. They don’t require soaking overnight or long cooking times like many other beans, so they are a great option for a relatively last minute dish. It’s always a good idea to keep lentils in your pantry for this reason.

While this soup recipe has a healthy list of ingredients, almost all of the prep can be done a day in advance. Once the vegetables are ready and chopped, the recipe is extremely straightforward and easy, can be made in one pot just requires a bit of sauté and simmer time. I hope you enjoy this perfect-year-round soup recipe as much as I do and make it over and over again! *Mangia bene!*

## Ingredients

Sweet Potato Lentil Kale Soup is a nutritional powerhouse from the abundant vegetables and lentils. To make it we’ll need:

- **Red Lentils**: If you don’t have [red lentils](https://amzn.to/4ekL3Tj), the best substitutes are yellow or [brown lentils](https://amzn.to/4dtfnd9). Other lentils, such as green, black and [French lentils](https://amzn.to/3zt8n21), can also be used but will required more time to cook and additional broth. See **Frequently Asked Questions** below for more about the different varieties of lentils.
- **Sweet Potatoes**: Any type of sweet potato or yam can be used in this recipe. If all you have on hand are regular, white potatoes, they can be used. Butternut squash would also be great here!
- **Kale**: This is a very hearty, veggie-forward lentil soup with loads of nutrition from all the vegetables. Dark leafy greens go so well with lentils and also add loads of flavor and texture. I use fresh *lacinato* kale (a.k.a., Tuscan or black kale) in this recipe, but have used frozen spinach and kale successfully dozens of times. Regular green kale, which is more fibrous and takes longer to cook, can also be used.
- **Tomato Paste**: Adds *umami* (savoriness) and a depth of flavor to the soup.
- **Broth**: Use a no- or low-sodium vegetable broth if at all possible.
- **Onions, Celery, Carrots, Garlic**: Important aromatics and the foundation for flavor in most soups. The carrots are optional in this recipe since it also contains sweet potatoes. (Both carrots and sweet potatoes add a bit of sweetness.)
- **Spices**: The eastern Mediterranean/Middle Eastern flavor profile of this soup comes from its special blend of spices–smoked paprika, cumin and coriander plus a little red pepper flakes for a touch of heat.

## How to Make Sweet Potato and Red Lentil Soup

- Gather and prep all ingredients according to specifications above. Place the lentils on a sheet pan and look for any stones or debris and discard. Rinse the lentils well under running cold water using a colander.
	- ***PRO-TIP***: If you don’t have red lentils, the best substitutes are yellow or brown lentils. Other lentils, such as green, black and French lentils, can also be used but will required more time to cook and additional broth.
- Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Add the onions, carrots, celery, garlic, paprika and red pepper flakes and stir. Cook for about 4 minutes, or until vegetables have softened a bit, stirring occasionally.
- Then, move onion mixture to one side of pot. Add tomato paste and cook it for about 1 minute, then stir it with the rest of the vegetables.

## Recipe Substitutions and Variations

- **Lentils**: Use any lentil that you’d like in this Sweet Potato Lentil Kale Soup recipe. Check out **Frequently Asked Questions** above for more about this.
- **Make it Heartier**: Follow the guidelines in my [Lentil Sausage Soup](https://mangiawithmichele.com/lentil-soup-with-sausage/) and add some hearty Italian sausage to this recipe. Of course, it will no longer be vegan with the sausage included!
- **Don’t like kale?** Lots of dark leafy greens work great in this recipe, such as mild spinach, swiss chard and escarole. Frozen spinach is also a great option in a pinch and I use it often in this soup.
- **Want a Smoother Soup?** If you prefer a smoother soup, you can puree this lentil soup either before or after adding the greens with a hand blender. The soup will thicker as well if you do this. I have some great instructions about how to use an [immersion (hand) blender](https://linksta.io/3e38a02d?token=eyJ0IjoxNzYwODM2MzQyMDAwLCJoIjoiYWIyYmYwMzQ3NjMyMmQ0ODkwNTYzZWViZTk1Mzc2NjY5ZGQ3ZDdlZjliZjZmYjhhNWM1Mjg2MTM5OGRiYTU4NiJ9) in my [Sweet Potato with Apple Soup recipe](https://mangiawithmichele.com/sweet-potato-soup-with-apples/).
- **Spices:** If you’d like to make this more of a sweet potato and red lentil curry with Indian spices, switch out the cumin and coriander for curry powder and *garam masala*. Alternatively, for more Thai-inspired flavors, use some red curry paste and finish with a little light coconut milk.

### Notes

- This recipe makes large batch–about 12 cups soup. I figured on about 1½ cups portion per serving but adjust accordingly. Cut this recipe in half for a smaller yield.
- Any type of sweet potato or yam can be used in this recipe. Butternut squash would also be great here!
- Frozen spinach or kale is a great substitute for the fresh kale. Also, I prefer Tuscan kale (a.k.a., lacinato or black kale) but regular kale, which is more fibrous and takes longer to cook, can be used.
- Be sure to pick through the lentils for any stones and rinse the lentils under running cold water before adding to pot.
- If you don’t have red lentils, the best substitutes are yellow or brown lentils. Other lentils, such as green, black and French lentils, can also be used but will required more time to cook and additional broth.
- If you prefer a thinner soup, increase the broth.
- To save time when cooking, prep the vegetables in advance and store them in a zip-lock bag in the refrigerator for up to one day.
- The amount of salt that you’ll need depends on the salt level of the broth. It’s always best to use no- or low-sodium broths and stocks if possible so you have more control over the dish’s saltiness.
- Soup leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator in an air-tight container for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.
- Consider portioning extra soup into containers to enjoy down the road! Reheat it slowly over medium low heat while stirring, adding additional broth or water if needed.
