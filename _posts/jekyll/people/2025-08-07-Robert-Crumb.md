**Robert Dennis Crumb** ([/ k r ʌ m /](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English"); born August 30, 1943) is an American artist who often signs his work **R. Crumb**. His work displays a nostalgia for [American folk culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore_of_the_United_States "Folklore of the United States") of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and satire of contemporary American culture.

Crumb contributed to many of the seminal works of the [underground comix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_comix "Underground comix") movement in the 1960s, including being a founder of the first successful underground comix publication, *[Zap Comix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zap_Comix "Zap Comix")*, contributing to all 16 issues. He was additionally contributing to the *[East Village Other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Village_Other "East Village Other")* and many other publications, including a variety of one-off and anthology comics. During this time, inspired by psychedelics and cartoons from the 1920s and 1930s, he introduced a wide variety of characters that became extremely popular, including [countercultural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s "Counterculture of the 1960s") icons [Fritz the Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_the_Cat "Fritz the Cat") and [Mr. Natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Natural_\(comics\) "Mr. Natural (comics)"), and the images from his *[Keep On Truckin'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_On_Truckin%27_\(comics\) "Keep On Truckin' (comics)")* strip. Sexual themes abounded in all these projects, often shading into [scatological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatology "Scatology") and pornographic comics. In the mid-1970s, he contributed to the *[Arcade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_\(comics_magazine\) "Arcade (comics magazine)")* anthology; following the decline of the underground, he moved towards biographical and autobiographical subjects while refining his drawing style, a heavily [crosshatched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatching "Hatching") pen-and-ink style inspired by late 19th- and early 20th-century cartooning. Much of his work appeared in a magazine he founded, *[Weirdo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weirdo_\(comics\) "Weirdo (comics)")* (1981–1993), which was one of the most prominent publications of the [alternative comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_comics "Alternative comics") era. As his career progressed, his comic work became more autobiographical.
