Wow that is a thing of beauty. Can't believe I've never seen this. What is it exactly? What does accessory mean in this case?

That campaign was the Grail for my early college group. It’s so hard to build a party from scratch to beat those modules using second edition. Or maybe we were just rough as DM’s I don’t know.

I had it and like it because they never detailed that area previously. Cool setting.

One thing I always find interesting was as synonymous R.A. Salvadore became with the Forgotten Realms in this era because of his novels. If I remember correctly, this is the only module with his name credited to it.
