![Creepy, Sleazy & Well-Hung- Wicked Wall-Candy from Cult Movies, Sex Flicks and Bloody Slasher Films](https://cdn1.dangerousminds.net/uploads/7/2025/06/Creepy-Sleazy-Well-Hung-Wicked-Wall-Candy-from-Cult-Movies-Sex-Flicks-and-Bloody-Slasher-Films-Dangerous-Minds-1140x855.jpg)

Stumbling across Westgate Gallery is like getting clocked in the head with a forgotten Betamax copy of *Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS* and waking up in a fever dream curated by and Russ Meyer. It’s not a gallery, it’s a goddamn temple; walls drenched in day-glo hysteria, satanic nuns, kung-fu broads, bug-eyed aliens, and enough violent giallo chic to make your retinas haemorrhage joy. Imagine if Alejandro Jodorowsky and Jack Smith ran a video store inside a strip club—it might look something like this.

What elevates Westgate from oddball poster depot to full-blown ritual chamber of pulp worship is its resident curator of filth and celluloid glory: Christian McLaughlin. Part historian, part smut priest, he doesn’t just sling paper—he conjures ghosts. McLaughlin has an encyclopaedic handle on the lurid netherworld of exploitation cinema, from Euro-trash sleaze to XXX-rated arthouse to long-buried 1970s horror flicks that played exactly [once in some Long Beach grindhouse](https://dangerousminds.net/comments/program_your_own_grindhouse_film_festival_with_these_sleazy_cult_favorites/). He doesn’t just find the posters; he knows their secrets.
