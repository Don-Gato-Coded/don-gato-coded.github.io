Art Nouveau, meaning "New Art" in French, was an ornamental style of art that flourished across Europe and the United States between approximately 1890 and 1910. It emerged as a deliberate attempt to create a new style, free from the imitative historicism that dominated much of 19th-century art and design. Key characteristics include a focus on natural forms and structures, particularly the curved lines of plants and flowers.
