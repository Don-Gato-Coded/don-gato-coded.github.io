Oil painting is a classic medium that has been used by artists for centuries, resulting in some of the most iconic works in [[art general]]. The technique involves using pigments mixed with drying oils, such as linseed oil, to create a durable and vibrant final piece. This method is renowned for its rich colors and the ability to create a wide range of textures and effects, from smooth and blended gradients to thick, impasto applications. Many famous movements, such as [[art nouveau]], have utilized oil paints to create their masterpieces.
