Who, Me? Well, would you look at the calendar? It’s Monday already, and by lunchtime any fond memories of the weekend will have been erased by work worries of the sort *The Register* celebrates each week in “Who, Me?” – the reader-contributed column that tells your stories of making messes and somehow escaping.

This week, meet a reader we’ll Regomize as “Alejandro” who told us he once worked for a major multinational company and in the early 1990s was trained to perform a mainframe migration project. The plan was to bring a payroll app into the late 20th century by moving from a 1970s-vintage IBM box to a new NCR machine that ran Unix.
