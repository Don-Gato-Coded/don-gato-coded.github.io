“The Elderly Having Delicious Food” by Xiaoling Li (China). Overall Winner and Winner, Food for the Family supported by the Felix Project.  
“In an early spring afternoon in Shuangliu Ancient Town, Sichuan Province, China, five elderly ladies in their eighties sit together. Wearing colorful jackets and wool hats, they happily eat the famous Sichuan snack ‘Spring rolls’. A wrap of thin homemade dough, filled with cucumber, carrot, and shredded scallions, drizzled with green mustard, Sichuan pepper, red oil, sweet sauce, and sprinkled with sesame seeds. They are “setting up a Dragon Gate formation” – an expression used in China to refer to neighbourhood friends coming together to chat, gossip, and share stories. Food makes these people happy; they enjoy a beautiful and joyful life.” (World Food Photography Awards sponsored by Bimi®)

A group of women enjoying friendship, laughter, and food has won the [2025 World Food Photography Awards](https://www.worldfoodphotographyawards.com/) sponsored by Bimi®. The photograph, taken by photographer Xiaoling Li in Sichuan Province, shows five elderly ladies eating some snacks and chatting, demonstrating how food brings us together. The image beat out nearly 10,000 submissions from photographers in 70 countries.

“What a perfect winning image for our times,” says Caroline Kenyon, founder of the World Food Photography Awards sponsored by Bimi®. “This beautifully framed shot captures five elderly women in Sichuan Province, reveling in good food with true friends. The joy they have in each other’s company is palpable, a powerful rebuke to those who would divide us. Color, composition, the variety of expressions while one determinedly plows on with their food—I defy anyone not to be uplifted by this photograph.”

In addition to the overall winner, exceptional food photography was singled out across a wide variety of categories. From food styling to product shots to awards for innovation and phone photography, the winning images demonstrate the myriad ways that cuisine can be documented.

Judged by expert food photographers, chefs, restaurateurs, cookbook authors, and photo editors, the exceptional images show the true art behind this type of photography. In telling stories around food, these photographers are also telling tales of tradition, culture, and human relationships.

“These Awards showcase the power of photography in telling incredible food stories from around the world,” says Dave Samuels, brand director of Tenderstem® Bimi® Broccolini and headline sponsor of the Awards. “No matter how the world changes, food remains at the heart of our lives. These extraordinary images serve as a reminder of the fundamental role food plays across communities; bringing people together through growing, cooking, eating, celebrating, and surviving.”

“Delfina, A Pasta Granny” by Lizzie Mayson (UK). Winner, Claire Aho Award for Women Photographers.  
“This is Delfina, I took her portrait as part of a bigger project documenting pasta grannies in Italy. Here, we are in the region of Lazio. On the bed is an angel hair type of pasta called Fieno di Canepina. It is technically very hard to make: Delfina rolls the pasta out, flicks a huge piece the size of the table out like a bed sheet, folds it concertina style, then slices it up finely. The best part is that she makes this huge amount then delivers it to the local church where they cook it up and feed homeless people.” (World Food Photography Awards sponsored by Bimi®)
