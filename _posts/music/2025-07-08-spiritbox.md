[Spiritbox](https://consequence.net/artist/spiritbox/) hit the stage at on Monday (July 7th) for a performance of their song “Soft Spine” in their late-night television debut.

After an introduction from guest host Anthony Anderson, the camera cut to black-and-white for the absolutely crushing rendition of the track, which hails from the Canadian metal band’s 2025 album *[Tsunami Sea](https://consequence.net/2024/11/spiritbox-new-album-tsunami-sea-perfect-soul/)* — one of the [top heavy albums of 2025 so far](https://consequence.net/list/best-metal-albums-hard-rock-of-2025-so-far/).

While the group has plenty of melodic material that would have slotted it smoothly with the late-night format, Spiritbox boldly opted for one of their most aggro songs — a three-minute pounder with nu-metal riffs and fiery vocals from frontwoman Courtney LaPlante. Any unaware network TV viewers were certainly in for a shock.
