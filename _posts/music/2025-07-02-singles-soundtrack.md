> *Singles* is often seen as a *sui generis* rock-historical document because of its ostensible realism. Crowe’s love letter to his adopted hometown—shot on site and cast with actual locals—was composed in the moments before Seattle became a synecdoche for rock’s latest rebirth, and was rush-released to coincide with a moment that it, in turn, further fueled. Twenty-five years later, when local scenes are inextricable from their immediate online hype and a churn of thinkpieces mourn rock’s latest “death,” *Singles* feels less like Hollywood realism and more like the conjured ghost of a dead moment. As in the early 1990s, so it is today: rock lies in wait, ready for its resurrection through some authentic commercial séance. Maybe Cornell knew best, growling on the *Singles* soundtrack: “The snake retreats/Admits defeat/And waits for the birth ritual.”
