**John Michael** " **Ozzy** " **Osbourne** (3 December 1948 ‚Äì 22 July 2025) was an English singer, songwriter, and media personality who co-founded the pioneering [heavy metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music "Heavy metal music") band [Black Sabbath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath "Black Sabbath") in 1968, and rose to prominence in the 1970s as their lead vocalist. He then formed his own band in the early 1980s. During this time, he [adopted the title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorific_nicknames_in_popular_music "Honorific nicknames in popular music") " **Prince of Darkness** ".[^3] [^4]

Osbourne was vocalist on Black Sabbath's [first eight albums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath_discography "Black Sabbath discography"). The band pioneered heavy metal music, particularly with *[Black Sabbath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath_\(album\) "Black Sabbath (album)")*, *[Paranoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoid_\(album\) "Paranoid (album)")* (both 1970) and *[Master of Reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Reality "Master of Reality")* (1971). Osbourne was fired from Black Sabbath in 1979 due to his problems with alcohol and other drugs. He then founded his own band with [Randy Rhoads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Rhoads "Randy Rhoads") and [Bob Daisley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Daisley "Bob Daisley"), who recorded the albums *[Blizzard of Ozz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blizzard_of_Ozz "Blizzard of Ozz")* (1980) and *[Diary of a Madman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary_of_a_Madman_\(album\) "Diary of a Madman (album)")* (1981). Osbourne released [thirteen studio albums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzy_Osbourne_discography "Ozzy Osbourne discography"), the first seven of which were certified multi-platinum in the United States. In the 1980s, Osbourne drew controversy for his antics both onstage and offstage, and was accused of promoting [Satanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanism "Satanism") by the [Christian right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_right "Christian right"). He reunited with Black Sabbath on several occasions. He rejoined from 1997 to 2005, and again in 2012; during this second reunion he sang on the band's last studio album, *[13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13_\(Black_Sabbath_album\) "13 (Black Sabbath album)")* (2013), before they embarked on [a farewell tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_Tour "The End Tour") that ended in 2017. On 5 July 2025, Osbourne performed his final show at the [Back to the Beginning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Beginning "Back to the Beginning") concert in [Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham "Birmingham"), having announced that it would be his last due to health issues. Although he intended to continue recording music, he died 17 days later, on 22 July.
