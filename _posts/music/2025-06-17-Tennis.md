The story behind husband and wife duo Alaina Moore and Patrick Riley -- better known as Tennis -- has been compelling from the start. Their debut was fueled by an epic sailing trip, and their second release is produced by The Black Keys' Patrick Carney. We catch up with this intrepid duo when they bring their band to Morning Becomes Eclectic in the 11 o'clock hour.
