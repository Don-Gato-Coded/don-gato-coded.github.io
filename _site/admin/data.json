(A caveat being that writing is fortunately easy to both quantify and automate.)</p>\n\n<p>Output-based goals that I've been having the most trouble with are the ones that I haven't really found a good input-based supplementary goal to add to it. I do really well with beemergencys pushing me towards doing work, but output goals don't have a daily metric, they're usually weekly or monthly.</p>\n\n<p>I finally had the brilliant idea to use RescueTime and track the amount of time that I'm specifically on Lynda each day to supplement <strong>/courses</strong>. I had a few good ideas for tracking pages read or time with <strong>/books</strong>, but I often get weasel-y if the data isn't automated. 😅 So it'd be nice to figure out a way to connect with Kindle or Audible.</p>\n\n<p>(P.S. Working on a new Jekyll theme this week, <a href=\"https://github.com/brennanbrown/purelog\">Purelog</a>!)</p>\n\n<p>(P.S.S. Anybody doing NaNoWriMo this year? Using Beeminder to track it?)</p>\n\n</div><div class=\"row\" id=\"author\">\n        <!-- <div class=\"col-xl-3 col-12\">\n            <img src=\"https://brennanbrown.ca/img/avatar.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail d-block mx-auto\"/>\n        </div> -->\n        <div class=\"col-xl-9 col-12\" id=\"author-text\">\n            <h2 class=\"text-lg-left text-center\">\n                About\n                DonGato\n            </h2>\n            <p>\n                A digital nomad.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div><!-- BACKLINKS --><!-- RELATED POSTS --></article></div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n                <button class=\"scroll-to-top\" id=\"scroll-to-top\">\n                    UP <i class=\"fa fa-chevron-up\"></i>\n                </button>\n            </div>\n        </main>\n        <!-- FOOTER -->\n<footer class=\"page-footer font-small blue\" id=\"footer\">\n    <div class=\"container-fluid text-sm-left\">\n        <div class=\"row\">\n            <div class=\"col-sm-6 mt-sm-0 my-3\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-uppercase text-center\">About\n                    The Blacklist</h2>\n                <p class=\"text-justify text-white mx-3\">\n                    <small>The phrase \"digital garden\" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating.</small>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"col-sm-3 col-6 mb-sm-0 mb-1\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-uppercase\">Directory</h2>\n                <ul class=\"list-unstyled\">\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"/home\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-home\"></i>\n                            Home Page</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"/about\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-signature\"></i>\n                            About</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"/posts\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-flag\"></i>\n                            Blog Posts</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"/feeds\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-rss-square\"></i>\n                            RSS Feeds</a>\n                    </li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"col-sm-3 col-6 mb-sm-0 mb-1\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-uppercase\">Other Places</h2>\n                <ul class=\"list-unstyled\">\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"https://github.com/don-gato-coded\">\n                            <i class=\"fab fa-github\"></i>\n                            GitHub</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/miblanco04\">\n                            <i class=\"fab fa-twitter\"></i>\n                            Twitter</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-briefcase\"></i>\n                            Portfolio</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"mailto:don-gato-coded@gmail.com\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-envelope\"></i>\n                            E-mail</a>\n                    </li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footer-copyright text-center py-1 px-5\">\n        Source Code licensed\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/brennanbrown/enjoyment-work/blob/master/LICENSE\">MIT</a>\n        2025.\n        <br/>\n        Website content licensed\n        <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a>\n        |\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/brennanbrown/enjoyment-work\">\n            View Source Code\n        </a>\n\n    </div>\n</footer>\n\n        <!-- SCRIPTS -->\n<script>\n  document\n    .getElementById(\"scroll-to-top\")\n    .addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n      window.scrollTo({\n        top: 0,\n        left: 0,\n        behavior: \"smooth\",\n      });\n    });\n</script>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    window.MathJax = {\n        tex: {\n            packages: [\"base\", \"ams\"]\n        },\n        loader: {\n            load: [\"ui/menu\", \"[tex]/ams\"]\n        }\n    };\n</script>\n\n<script async id=\"MathJax-script\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-chtml.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n\n<script defer src=\"/assets/js/main.js\"></script>\n\n    </body>\n</html>","excerpt":"<p>Alright, let's get into the weeds this week (or perhaps flowers?).

Brown","slug":"October-20th-2020","ext":".md"},"content":"<p>Another busy bee week! Time seems to be flying by for me. On the forums, I was given the <em>Regular</em> badge, meaning I can change thread titles, such as \"Brennan's Beeminder Journal 2020\" to \"Brennan's Beeminder Journal\", which allows this Beejournal to continue ad infinitum, huzzah!</p>\n\n<p>Regarding <em>/morning-pages</em>, the solution I found was to use <a href=\"https://help.beeminder.com/article/88-urlminder\"><strong>URLminder</strong></a>, this will track the word count of (multiple) Google Docs or Dropbox documents. I figure I'll add a new document each month, as I find that's a good time-frame to segment writing. And unlike Draft, URLminder lets you change the deadline time, which was my entire problem in the first place. The caveat being that I'll need to adjust to writing somewhere else consistently.</p>\n\n<p>This week's verbal contract will be: To get a better at understanding API. Although I've found multiple new systems within the unofficial integration lists that I'm excited to use, it made me realize how much more potential there is–and perhaps the frustration that 3rd party solutions seem so ephemeral. <a href=\"https://github.com/Khan/khan-api/blob/master/README.md\">Khan Academy</a>, for instance, have deprecated their API entirely. <a href=\"https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/open-api\">FreeCodeCamp</a> hasn't had theirs updated in nearly two years. Is interest in this kind of things just too niche?</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I think there's benefit in there only being thirty or so high-quality official integrations. I know when I first was starting out, I didn't feel overwhelmed by the paradox of choice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-systems\">New Systems</h2>\n\n<p>As I've written about a few weeks ago, limitation breeds creativity for me. It's been fun trying to work with just the official integrations, but this would not be an experiment of self-improvement if stagnation was allowed! Exciting things are going on, I'm trying a bunch of new stuff.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.beeminder.com/brennanbrown/clozemaster\"><strong>/ClozeMaster:</strong></a> Supplement my French learning with Duolingo</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.beeminder.com/brennanbrown/meditation\"><strong>/Meditation:</strong></a> It's so cool how you can use Apple Health to track mindful minutes with different meditation apps. I'm still have to figure out my favorite but right now I'm using Headspace.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.beeminder.com/brennanbrown/prayer\"><strong>/Prayer:</strong></a> Using Rosarium (<a href=\"https://blog.beeminder.com/rosary/\">Beeminder's blog post about it</a>), my relationship with spirituality is <em>complicated</em>, but I definitely enjoy the Rosary prayer, and it's a good way to start my days with the right intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>P.S. I figured out why RescueTime was still measuring time even though I was AFK. It has to do with a pesky <a href=\"https://www.unixreich.com/blog/2013/linux-nvidia-optimus-on-thinkpad-w520w530-with-external-monitor-finally-solved/\">design flaw</a> (<a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_ThinkPad_W520#Nvidia_Optimus_Setup\">more detail</a>) of the ThinkPad W520 (which, by the way, is the best laptop ever minus this one thing).</p>\n\n<p>P.S.S. Also added a link to @narthur's <a href=\"https://www.nathanarthur.com/beeminder-wiki/\">beewiki</a> to <a href=\"https://journal.bar\">journal.bar</a>, I hope it catches on!

Time seems to be flying by for me. On the forums, I was given the <em>Regular</em> badge, meaning I can change thread titles, such as \"Brennan's Beeminder Journal 2020\" to \"Brennan's Beeminder Journal\", which allows this Beejournal to continue ad infinitum, huzzah!</p>\n\n<p>Regarding <em>/morning-pages</em>, the solution I found was to use <a href=\"https://help.beeminder.com/article/88-urlminder\"><strong>URLminder</strong></a>, this will track the word count of (multiple) Google Docs or Dropbox documents. I figure I'll add a new document each month, as I find that's a good time-frame to segment writing. And unlike Draft, URLminder lets you change the deadline time, which was my entire problem in the first place. The caveat being that I'll need to adjust to writing somewhere else consistently.</p>\n\n<p>This week's verbal contract will be: To get a better at understanding API. Although I've found multiple new systems within the unofficial integration lists that I'm excited to use, it made me realize how much more potential there is–and perhaps the frustration that 3rd party solutions seem so ephemeral. <a href=\"https://github.com/Khan/khan-api/blob/master/README.md\">Khan Academy</a>, for instance, have deprecated their API entirely. <a href=\"https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/open-api\">FreeCodeCamp</a> hasn't had theirs updated in nearly two years. Is interest in this kind of things just too niche?</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I think there's benefit in there only being thirty or so high-quality official integrations. I know when I first was starting out, I didn't feel overwhelmed by the paradox of choice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-systems\">New Systems</h2>\n\n<p>As I've written about a few weeks ago, limitation breeds creativity for me. It's been fun trying to work with just the official integrations, but this would not be an experiment of self-improvement if stagnation was allowed! Exciting things are going on, I'm trying a bunch of new stuff.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.beeminder.com/brennanbrown/clozemaster\"><strong>/ClozeMaster:</strong></a> Supplement my French learning with Duolingo</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.beeminder.com/brennanbrown/meditation\"><strong>/Meditation:</strong></a> It's so cool how you can use Apple Health to track mindful minutes with different meditation apps. I'm still have to figure out my favorite but right now I'm using Headspace.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.beeminder.com/brennanbrown/prayer\"><strong>/Prayer:</strong></a> Using Rosarium (<a href=\"https://blog.beeminder.com/rosary/\">Beeminder's blog post about it</a>), my relationship with spirituality is <em>complicated</em>, but I definitely enjoy the Rosary prayer, and it's a good way to start my days with the right intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>P.S. I figured out why RescueTime was still measuring time even though I was AFK. It has to do with a pesky <a href=\"https://www.unixreich.com/blog/2013/linux-nvidia-optimus-on-thinkpad-w520w530-with-external-monitor-finally-solved/\">design flaw</a> (<a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_ThinkPad_W520#Nvidia_Optimus_Setup\">more detail</a>) of the ThinkPad W520 (which, by the way, is the best laptop ever minus this one thing).</p>\n\n<p>P.S.S.

Brown","slug":"October-13th-2020","ext":".md"},"content":"<p>Quite a red-letter day for my neighbours south of the border. I would be lying if I said I wasn't anxious for tonight, so I better finish this weekly review as early as possible :^)</p>\n\n<p>First off, my apologies for this post not being very Beeminder-specific, I've been getting dedicated with my development work with Jekyll the past week. So I haven't really given the time needed to examine how my Beeminder goals have been affecting things in my life, like I usually (neurotically) do. I'm planning to do a full review of my now 24(!) systems.</p>\n\n<p>Some bad news and good news: The bad news is that I definitely bit off more than I can chew with trying to modify Enjoyment work. It already had a 1,300 line CSS file, and I decided it would be a good idea to add Bootstrap on top of that, and although I love how it looks and what it's capable of, it's hopelessly bloated.</p>\n\n<p>The good news is that I successfully completed <a href=\"https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/\"><strong>Hacktoberfest</strong></a> for the first time! But even better, I went back to the drawing board and created my first open-source project for others: <a href=\"https://github.com/brennanbrown/watery\"><strong>Watery</strong></a>, which is the most minimal yet functional Jekyll theme I could create. I went down the rabbit hole of <a href=\"https://github.com/dbohdan/classless-css\">classless CSS frameworks</a> and used the most popular one, Water.css, for this.</p>\n\n<p>I also just added a neat feature on the <a href=\"https://watery.netlify.app\"><strong>demo site</strong></a> that lets you effortlessly see how it would look using a different classless CSS framework instead, which really demonstrates its extensibility.</p>\n\n<p>To tie it back to relevancy, I am probably going to use a variant of this theme for my Beeminder blog <a href=\"https://journal.bar/\">journal.bar</a>. Speaking of, I've been thinking more down-the-line about this experiment, and trying to figure out if there would be any meaningful way to measure difference from the beginning to, say, a year after. I can offer my own layman's observations, but it'd be neat to be an academic guinea pig.</p>\n","tags":[],"relative_path":"_journals/November-3rd-2020.md","path":"_journals/November-3rd-2020.md","date":"2025-05-23 17:20:32 -0400","output":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n

I would be lying if I said I wasn't anxious for tonight, so I better finish this weekly review as early as possible :^)</p>\n\n<p>First off, my apologies for this post not being very Beeminder-specific, I've been getting dedicated with my development work with Jekyll the past week. So I haven't really given the time needed to examine how my Beeminder goals have been affecting things in my life, like I usually (neurotically) do. I'm planning to do a full review of my now 24(!) systems.</p>\n\n<p>Some bad news and good news: The bad news is that I definitely bit off more than I can chew with trying to modify Enjoyment work. It already had a 1,300 line CSS file, and I decided it would be a good idea to add Bootstrap on top of that, and although I love how it looks and what it's capable of, it's hopelessly bloated.</p>\n\n<p>The good news is that I successfully completed <a href=\"https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/\"><strong>Hacktoberfest</strong></a> for the first time! But even better, I went back to the drawing board and created my first open-source project for others: <a href=\"https://github.com/brennanbrown/watery\"><strong>Watery</strong></a>, which is the most minimal yet functional Jekyll theme I could create. I went down the rabbit hole of <a href=\"https://github.com/dbohdan/classless-css\">classless CSS frameworks</a> and used the most popular one, Water.css, for this.</p>\n\n<p>I also just added a neat feature on the <a href=\"https://watery.netlify.app\"><strong>demo site</strong></a> that lets you effortlessly see how it would look using a different classless CSS framework instead, which really demonstrates its extensibility.</p>\n\n<p>To tie it back to relevancy, I am probably going to use a variant of this theme for my Beeminder blog <a href=\"https://journal.bar/\">journal.bar</a>. Speaking of, I've been thinking more down-the-line about this experiment, and trying to figure out if there would be any meaningful way to measure difference from the beginning to, say, a year after. I can offer my own layman's observations, but it'd be neat to be an academic guinea pig.</p>\n\n</div><div class=\"row\" id=\"author\">\n        <!-- <div class=\"col-xl-3 col-12\">\n            <img src=\"https://brennanbrown.ca/img/avatar.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail d-block mx-auto\"/>\n        </div> -->\n        <div class=\"col-xl-9 col-12\" id=\"author-text\">\n            <h2 class=\"text-lg-left text-center\">\n                About\n                DonGato\n            </h2>\n            <p>\n                A digital nomad.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div><!-- BACKLINKS --><!-- RELATED POSTS --></article></div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n                <button class=\"scroll-to-top\" id=\"scroll-to-top\">\n                    UP <i class=\"fa fa-chevron-up\"></i>\n                </button>\n            </div>\n        </main>\n        <!-- FOOTER -->\n<footer class=\"page-footer font-small blue\" id=\"footer\">\n    <div class=\"container-fluid text-sm-left\">\n        <div class=\"row\">\n            <div class=\"col-sm-6 mt-sm-0 my-3\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-uppercase text-center\">About\n                    The Blacklist</h2>\n                <p class=\"text-justify text-white mx-3\">\n                    <small>The phrase \"digital garden\" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating.</small>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"col-sm-3 col-6 mb-sm-0 mb-1\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-uppercase\">Directory</h2>\n                <ul class=\"list-unstyled\">\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"/home\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-home\"></i>\n                            Home Page</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"/about\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-signature\"></i>\n                            About</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"/posts\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-flag\"></i>\n                            Blog Posts</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"/feeds\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-rss-square\"></i>\n                            RSS Feeds</a>\n                    </li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"col-sm-3 col-6 mb-sm-0 mb-1\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-uppercase\">Other Places</h2>\n                <ul class=\"list-unstyled\">\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"https://github.com/don-gato-coded\">\n                            <i class=\"fab fa-github\"></i>\n                            GitHub</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/miblanco04\">\n                            <i class=\"fab fa-twitter\"></i>\n                            Twitter</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-briefcase\"></i>\n                            Portfolio</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"mailto:don-gato-coded@gmail.com\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-envelope\"></i>\n                            E-mail</a>\n                    </li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footer-copyright text-center py-1 px-5\">\n        Source Code licensed\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/brennanbrown/enjoyment-work/blob/master/LICENSE\">MIT</a>\n        2025.\n        <br/>\n        Website content licensed\n        <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a>\n        |\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/brennanbrown/enjoyment-work\">\n            View Source Code\n        </a>\n\n    </div>\n</footer>\n\n        <!-- SCRIPTS -->\n<script>\n  document\n    .getElementById(\"scroll-to-top\")\n    .addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n      window.scrollTo({\n        top: 0,\n        left: 0,\n        behavior: \"smooth\",\n      });\n    });\n</script>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    window.MathJax = {\n        tex: {\n            packages: [\"base\", \"ams\"]\n        },\n        loader: {\n            load: [\"ui/menu\", \"[tex]/ams\"]\n        }\n    };\n</script>\n\n<script async id=\"MathJax-script\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-chtml.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n\n<script defer src=\"/assets/js/main.js\"></script>\n\n    </body>\n</html>","excerpt":"<p>Quite a red-letter day for my neighbours south of the border.

Brown","slug":"October-27th-2020","ext":".md"},"content":"<p>Yet <em>another</em> busy bee-week. I'm really enjoying becoming increasingly focused on both the weeds of technicalities, as well as trying to think deeper on the higher concepts that I'm trying to utilize.</p>\n\n<p>For starters, I've written in the past about wanting to pivot, but I realize that I am perfectly capable of adding work rather than changing what this project is.</p>\n\n<p>I've also written about wanting to give myself more self-permission. Essentially, I want a place that's truly mine where I can place my thoughts exhaustively. Not just polished, finished work such as my blog or portfolio. I'm writing roughly 400 words a day anyways, it might as well be for a utilitarian purpose and public.</p>\n\n<p>As much as I enjoy the concept of digital gardens as an ideal, I do have some problems with the specifics (also seen with Roam Research). It sort of reminds me of the Dvorak keyboard layout–far more practical and productive, but alas I'm am already far too entrenched in both QWERTY and traditional, hierarchical note-taking.</p>\n\n<p>I also don't want a specific program for private use, such as Notion. Rather, I found a wonderful <a href=\"https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/simply-jekyll\">Jekyll theme</a> that incorporates a lot of the concepts that I <em>am</em> drawn towards: Backlinks, wiki-style links, context menu, page preview, margininlia, etc. You can see these being <a href=\"https://simply-jekyll.netlify.app/posts/exploring-the-features-of-simply-jekyll\">utilized here</a>, it's really cool.</p>\n\n<p>To relate it back to Beeminder, in addition to collecting my notes, I want this to be a place for daily entries, that include getting more in-depth with my <strong>/gratitude</strong> journal, and <strong>/foodlog</strong>, for starters–and having the project be on GitHub means I can simply create a new system with GitMinder that only tracks that repository.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, much more related to Beeminder, I've been having trouble with URLminder. Currently, <a href=\"https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/mornning-pages2\"><strong>/morningpages2</strong></a> is kind of just stuck at around 4,300 words for some reason–maybe I just input the Google Doc link incorrectly. I also had to sadly archive <strong>/typing</strong>, since I couldn't get my TypeRacer games to sync, but that was a just-for-fun goal anyways.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Trying to get into APIs last week ended up snowballing into a new project of it's own: <a href=\"https://selfteach.academy/\"><strong>SelfTeach.Academy</strong></a>. I don't think there'd be enough interest to try to make this a reality, though.</p>\n","tags":[],"relative_path":"_journals/October-20th-2020.md","path":"_journals/October-20th-2020.md","date":"2025-05-23 17:20:32 -0400","output":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n

I'm really enjoying becoming increasingly focused on both the weeds of technicalities, as well as trying to think deeper on the higher concepts that I'm trying to utilize.</p>\n\n<p>For starters, I've written in the past about wanting to pivot, but I realize that I am perfectly capable of adding work rather than changing what this project is.</p>\n\n<p>I've also written about wanting to give myself more self-permission. Essentially, I want a place that's truly mine where I can place my thoughts exhaustively. Not just polished, finished work such as my blog or portfolio. I'm writing roughly 400 words a day anyways, it might as well be for a utilitarian purpose and public.</p>\n\n<p>As much as I enjoy the concept of digital gardens as an ideal, I do have some problems with the specifics (also seen with Roam Research). It sort of reminds me of the Dvorak keyboard layout–far more practical and productive, but alas I'm am already far too entrenched in both QWERTY and traditional, hierarchical note-taking.</p>\n\n<p>I also don't want a specific program for private use, such as Notion. Rather, I found a wonderful <a href=\"https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/simply-jekyll\">Jekyll theme</a> that incorporates a lot of the concepts that I <em>am</em> drawn towards: Backlinks, wiki-style links, context menu, page preview, margininlia, etc. You can see these being <a href=\"https://simply-jekyll.netlify.app/posts/exploring-the-features-of-simply-jekyll\">utilized here</a>, it's really cool.</p>\n\n<p>To relate it back to Beeminder, in addition to collecting my notes, I want this to be a place for daily entries, that include getting more in-depth with my <strong>/gratitude</strong> journal, and <strong>/foodlog</strong>, for starters–and having the project be on GitHub means I can simply create a new system with GitMinder that only tracks that repository.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, much more related to Beeminder, I've been having trouble with URLminder. Currently, <a href=\"https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/mornning-pages2\"><strong>/morningpages2</strong></a> is kind of just stuck at around 4,300 words for some reason–maybe I just input the Google Doc link incorrectly. I also had to sadly archive <strong>/typing</strong>, since I couldn't get my TypeRacer games to sync, but that was a just-for-fun goal anyways.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Trying to get into APIs last week ended up snowballing into a new project of it's own: <a href=\"https://selfteach.academy/\"><strong>SelfTeach.Academy</strong></a>. I don't think there'd be enough interest to try to make this a reality, though.</p>\n\n</div><div class=\"row\" id=\"author\">\n        <!-- <div class=\"col-xl-3 col-12\">\n            <img src=\"https://brennanbrown.ca/img/avatar.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail d-block mx-auto\"/>\n        </div> -->\n        <div class=\"col-xl-9 col-12\" id=\"author-text\">\n            <h2 class=\"text-lg-left text-center\">\n                About\n                DonGato\n            </h2>\n            <p>\n                A digital nomad.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div><!-- BACKLINKS --><!-- RELATED POSTS --></article></div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n                <button class=\"scroll-to-top\" id=\"scroll-to-top\">\n                    UP <i class=\"fa fa-chevron-up\"></i>\n                </button>\n            </div>\n        </main>\n        <!-- FOOTER -->\n<footer class=\"page-footer font-small blue\" id=\"footer\">\n    <div class=\"container-fluid text-sm-left\">\n        <div class=\"row\">\n            <div class=\"col-sm-6 mt-sm-0 my-3\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-uppercase text-center\">About\n                    The Blacklist</h2>\n                <p class=\"text-justify text-white mx-3\">\n                    <small>The phrase \"digital garden\" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating.</small>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"col-sm-3 col-6 mb-sm-0 mb-1\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-uppercase\">Directory</h2>\n                <ul class=\"list-unstyled\">\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"/home\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-home\"></i>\n                            Home Page</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"/about\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-signature\"></i>\n                            About</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"/posts\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-flag\"></i>\n                            Blog Posts</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"/feeds\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-rss-square\"></i>\n                            RSS Feeds</a>\n                    </li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"col-sm-3 col-6 mb-sm-0 mb-1\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-uppercase\">Other Places</h2>\n                <ul class=\"list-unstyled\">\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"https://github.com/don-gato-coded\">\n                            <i class=\"fab fa-github\"></i>\n                            GitHub</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/miblanco04\">\n                            <i class=\"fab fa-twitter\"></i>\n                            Twitter</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-briefcase\"></i>\n                            Portfolio</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"mailto:don-gato-coded@gmail.com\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-envelope\"></i>\n                            E-mail</a>\n                    </li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footer-copyright text-center py-1 px-5\">\n        Source Code licensed\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/brennanbrown/enjoyment-work/blob/master/LICENSE\">MIT</a>\n        2025.\n        <br/>\n        Website content licensed\n        <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a>\n        |\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/brennanbrown/enjoyment-work\">\n            View Source Code\n        </a>\n\n    </div>\n</footer>\n\n        <!-- SCRIPTS -->\n<script>\n  document\n    .getElementById(\"scroll-to-top\")\n    .addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n      window.scrollTo({\n        top: 0,\n        left: 0,\n        behavior: \"smooth\",\n      });\n    });\n</script>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    window.MathJax = {\n        tex: {\n            packages: [\"base\", \"ams\"]\n        },\n        loader: {\n            load: [\"ui/menu\", \"[tex]/ams\"]\n        }\n    };\n</script>\n\n<script async id=\"MathJax-script\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-chtml.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n\n<script defer src=\"/assets/js/main.js\"></script>\n\n    </body>\n</html>","excerpt":"<p>Yet <em>another</em> busy bee-week. I'm really enjoying becoming increasingly focused on both the weeds of technicalities, as well as trying to think deeper on the higher concepts that I'm trying to utilize.</p>\n","draft":false,"layout":"post","content-type":"journals","author":"Brennan K. Brown","slug":"October-20th-2020","ext":".md"},"content":"<p>Another busy bee week! Time seems to be flying by for me. On the forums, I was given the <em>Regular</em> badge, meaning I can change thread titles, such as \"Brennan's Beeminder Journal 2020\" to \"Brennan's Beeminder Journal\", which allows this Beejournal to continue ad infinitum, huzzah!</p>\n\n<p>Regarding <em>/morning-pages</em>, the solution I found was to use <a href=\"https://help.beeminder.com/article/88-urlminder\"><strong>URLminder</strong></a>, this will track the word count of (multiple) Google Docs or Dropbox documents. I figure I'll add a new document each month, as I find that's a good time-frame to segment writing. And unlike Draft, URLminder lets you change the deadline time, which was my entire problem in the first place. The caveat being that I'll need to adjust to writing somewhere else consistently.</p>\n\n<p>This week's verbal contract will be: To get a better at understanding API. Although I've found multiple new systems within the unofficial integration lists that I'm excited to use, it made me realize how much more potential there is–and perhaps the frustration that 3rd party solutions seem so ephemeral. <a href=\"https://github.com/Khan/khan-api/blob/master/README.md\">Khan Academy</a>, for instance, have deprecated their API entirely. <a href=\"https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/open-api\">FreeCodeCamp</a> hasn't had theirs updated in nearly two years. Is interest in this kind of things just too niche?</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I think there's benefit in there only being thirty or so high-quality official integrations. I know when I first was starting out, I didn't feel overwhelmed by the paradox of choice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-systems\">New Systems</h2>\n\n<p>As I've written about a few weeks ago, limitation breeds creativity for me. It's been fun trying to work with just the official integrations, but this would not be an experiment of self-improvement if stagnation was allowed! Exciting things are going on, I'm trying a bunch of new stuff.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.beeminder.com/brennanbrown/clozemaster\"><strong>/ClozeMaster:</strong></a> Supplement my French learning with Duolingo</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.beeminder.com/brennanbrown/meditation\"><strong>/Meditation:</strong></a> It's so cool how you can use Apple Health to track mindful minutes with different meditation apps. I'm still have to figure out my favorite but right now I'm using Headspace.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.beeminder.com/brennanbrown/prayer\"><strong>/Prayer:</strong></a> Using Rosarium (<a href=\"https://blog.beeminder.com/rosary/\">Beeminder's blog post about it</a>), my relationship with spirituality is <em>complicated</em>, but I definitely enjoy the Rosary prayer, and it's a good way to start my days with the right intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>P.S. I figured out why RescueTime was still measuring time even though I was AFK. It has to do with a pesky <a href=\"https://www.unixreich.com/blog/2013/linux-nvidia-optimus-on-thinkpad-w520w530-with-external-monitor-finally-solved/\">design flaw</a> (<a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_ThinkPad_W520#Nvidia_Optimus_Setup\">more detail</a>) of the ThinkPad W520 (which, by the way, is the best laptop ever minus this one thing).</p>\n\n<p>P.S.S. Also added a link to @narthur's <a href=\"https://www.nathanarthur.com/beeminder-wiki/\">beewiki</a> to <a href=\"https://journal.bar\">journal.bar</a>, I hope it catches on!

Time seems to be flying by for me. On the forums, I was given the <em>Regular</em> badge, meaning I can change thread titles, such as \"Brennan's Beeminder Journal 2020\" to \"Brennan's Beeminder Journal\", which allows this Beejournal to continue ad infinitum, huzzah!</p>\n\n<p>Regarding <em>/morning-pages</em>, the solution I found was to use <a href=\"https://help.beeminder.com/article/88-urlminder\"><strong>URLminder</strong></a>, this will track the word count of (multiple) Google Docs or Dropbox documents. I figure I'll add a new document each month, as I find that's a good time-frame to segment writing. And unlike Draft, URLminder lets you change the deadline time, which was my entire problem in the first place. The caveat being that I'll need to adjust to writing somewhere else consistently.</p>\n\n<p>This week's verbal contract will be: To get a better at understanding API. Although I've found multiple new systems within the unofficial integration lists that I'm excited to use, it made me realize how much more potential there is–and perhaps the frustration that 3rd party solutions seem so ephemeral. <a href=\"https://github.com/Khan/khan-api/blob/master/README.md\">Khan Academy</a>, for instance, have deprecated their API entirely. <a href=\"https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/open-api\">FreeCodeCamp</a> hasn't had theirs updated in nearly two years. Is interest in this kind of things just too niche?</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I think there's benefit in there only being thirty or so high-quality official integrations. I know when I first was starting out, I didn't feel overwhelmed by the paradox of choice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-systems\">New Systems</h2>\n\n<p>As I've written about a few weeks ago, limitation breeds creativity for me. It's been fun trying to work with just the official integrations, but this would not be an experiment of self-improvement if stagnation was allowed! Exciting things are going on, I'm trying a bunch of new stuff.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.beeminder.com/brennanbrown/clozemaster\"><strong>/ClozeMaster:</strong></a> Supplement my French learning with Duolingo</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.beeminder.com/brennanbrown/meditation\"><strong>/Meditation:</strong></a> It's so cool how you can use Apple Health to track mindful minutes with different meditation apps. I'm still have to figure out my favorite but right now I'm using Headspace.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.beeminder.com/brennanbrown/prayer\"><strong>/Prayer:</strong></a> Using Rosarium (<a href=\"https://blog.beeminder.com/rosary/\">Beeminder's blog post about it</a>), my relationship with spirituality is <em>complicated</em>, but I definitely enjoy the Rosary prayer, and it's a good way to start my days with the right intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>P.S. I figured out why RescueTime was still measuring time even though I was AFK. It has to do with a pesky <a href=\"https://www.unixreich.com/blog/2013/linux-nvidia-optimus-on-thinkpad-w520w530-with-external-monitor-finally-solved/\">design flaw</a> (<a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_ThinkPad_W520#Nvidia_Optimus_Setup\">more detail</a>) of the ThinkPad W520 (which, by the way, is the best laptop ever minus this one thing).</p>\n\n<p>P.S.S.

I've mostly been really busy with my new Jekyll digital garden project (which you can preview <a href=\"https://enjoymentwork.netlify.app\">here</a> if you're curious). It's crazy how many useful rabbit holes I've gone down in research, and with the serendipitous benefit of having the project's purpose be to archive and organize such rabbit holes!</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, sticking with Beeminder, I've noticed that <strong>/meditation</strong> seems a little selective with which \"mindful minutes\" it adds as data points–if it's a new medtiation from Headspace I haven't done before then it's added, but if it's one that I've already done then it doesn't seem to count it. I've noticed the iOS application updated though, so maybe it was just an anomaly.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I think the reason things were weird with URLminder reading from Google Docs was simply because I didn't set the privacy settings for the document correctly, whoops. Seems to be working now! I know it's been forever since I initially started with this goal–and I haven't really needed it since I've started a devlog on Draft that I plan to migrate–but I think it's still worth finally implementing correctly.</p>\n\n<p>I've been fumbling hard with <strong>/distraction</strong> lately. I've been derailing due to incorrect labeling of different websites I've been visiting, and it doesn't update like other systems do, to the point where it's 11:50 and it's still orange because it hasn't updated (and I know I shouldn't be in front of a screen that late, but that's another issue that needs to be tackled), which is a problem since it's a do-less goal.</p>\n\n<p>The simple solution to this is to just visit the RescueTime dashboard one per evening to make sure that the obscure sites I'm visiting are correctly labelled and that I'm not going over my unproductive screen-time limit.</p>\n","tags":[],"relative_path":"_journals/October-27th-2020.md","path":"_journals/October-27th-2020.md","date":"2025-05-23 17:20:32 -0400","output":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html

I've mostly been really busy with my new Jekyll digital garden project (which you can preview <a href=\"https://enjoymentwork.netlify.app\">here</a> if you're curious). It's crazy how many useful rabbit holes I've gone down in research, and with the serendipitous benefit of having the project's purpose be to archive and organize such rabbit holes!</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, sticking with Beeminder, I've noticed that <strong>/meditation</strong> seems a little selective with which \"mindful minutes\" it adds as data points–if it's a new medtiation from Headspace I haven't done before then it's added, but if it's one that I've already done then it doesn't seem to count it. I've noticed the iOS application updated though, so maybe it was just an anomaly.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I think the reason things were weird with URLminder reading from Google Docs was simply because I didn't set the privacy settings for the document correctly, whoops. Seems to be working now! I know it's been forever since I initially started with this goal–and I haven't really needed it since I've started a devlog on Draft that I plan to migrate–but I think it's still worth finally implementing correctly.</p>\n\n<p>I've been fumbling hard with <strong>/distraction</strong> lately. I've been derailing due to incorrect labeling of different websites I've been visiting, and it doesn't update like other systems do, to the point where it's 11:50 and it's still orange because it hasn't updated (and I know I shouldn't be in front of a screen that late, but that's another issue that needs to be tackled), which is a problem since it's a do-less goal.</p>\n\n<p>The simple solution to this is to just visit the RescueTime dashboard one per evening to make sure that the obscure sites I'm visiting are correctly labelled and that I'm not going over my unproductive screen-time limit.</p>\n\n</div><div class=\"row\" id=\"author\">\n        <!-- <div class=\"col-xl-3 col-12\">\n            <img src=\"https://brennanbrown.ca/img/avatar.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail

Brown","slug":"October-27th-2020","ext":".md"},"content":"<p>Yet <em>another</em> busy bee-week. I'm really enjoying becoming increasingly focused on both the weeds of technicalities, as well as trying to think deeper on the higher concepts that I'm trying to utilize.</p>\n\n<p>For starters, I've written in the past about wanting to pivot, but I realize that I am perfectly capable of adding work rather than changing what this project is.</p>\n\n<p>I've also written about wanting to give myself more self-permission. Essentially, I want a place that's truly mine where I can place my thoughts exhaustively. Not just polished, finished work such as my blog or portfolio. I'm writing roughly 400 words a day anyways, it might as well be for a utilitarian purpose and public.</p>\n\n<p>As much as I enjoy the concept of digital gardens as an ideal, I do have some problems with the specifics (also seen with Roam Research). It sort of reminds me of the Dvorak keyboard layout–far more practical and productive, but alas I'm am already far too entrenched in both QWERTY and traditional, hierarchical note-taking.</p>\n\n<p>I also don't want a specific program for private use, such as Notion. Rather, I found a wonderful <a href=\"https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/simply-jekyll\">Jekyll theme</a> that incorporates a lot of the concepts that I <em>am</em> drawn towards: Backlinks, wiki-style links, context menu, page preview, margininlia, etc. You can see these being <a href=\"https://simply-jekyll.netlify.app/posts/exploring-the-features-of-simply-jekyll\">utilized here</a>, it's really cool.</p>\n\n<p>To relate it back to Beeminder, in addition to collecting my notes, I want this to be a place for daily entries, that include getting more in-depth with my <strong>/gratitude</strong> journal, and <strong>/foodlog</strong>, for starters–and having the project be on GitHub means I can simply create a new system with GitMinder that only tracks that repository.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, much more related to Beeminder, I've been having trouble with URLminder. Currently, <a href=\"https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/mornning-pages2\"><strong>/morningpages2</strong></a> is kind of just stuck at around 4,300 words for some reason–maybe I just input the Google Doc link incorrectly. I also had to sadly archive <strong>/typing</strong>, since I couldn't get my TypeRacer games to sync, but that was a just-for-fun goal anyways.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Trying to get into APIs last week ended up snowballing into a new project of it's own: <a href=\"https://selfteach.academy/\"><strong>SelfTeach.Academy</strong></a>. I don't think there'd be enough interest to try to make this a reality, though.</p>\n","tags":[],"relative_path":"_journals/October-20th-2020.md","path":"_journals/October-20th-2020.md","date":"2025-05-23 17:20:32 -0400","output":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n

I'm really enjoying becoming increasingly focused on both the weeds of technicalities, as well as trying to think deeper on the higher concepts that I'm trying to utilize.</p>\n\n<p>For starters, I've written in the past about wanting to pivot, but I realize that I am perfectly capable of adding work rather than changing what this project is.</p>\n\n<p>I've also written about wanting to give myself more self-permission. Essentially, I want a place that's truly mine where I can place my thoughts exhaustively. Not just polished, finished work such as my blog or portfolio. I'm writing roughly 400 words a day anyways, it might as well be for a utilitarian purpose and public.</p>\n\n<p>As much as I enjoy the concept of digital gardens as an ideal, I do have some problems with the specifics (also seen with Roam Research). It sort of reminds me of the Dvorak keyboard layout–far more practical and productive, but alas I'm am already far too entrenched in both QWERTY and traditional, hierarchical note-taking.</p>\n\n<p>I also don't want a specific program for private use, such as Notion. Rather, I found a wonderful <a href=\"https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/simply-jekyll\">Jekyll theme</a> that incorporates a lot of the concepts that I <em>am</em> drawn towards: Backlinks, wiki-style links, context menu, page preview, margininlia, etc. You can see these being <a href=\"https://simply-jekyll.netlify.app/posts/exploring-the-features-of-simply-jekyll\">utilized here</a>, it's really cool.</p>\n\n<p>To relate it back to Beeminder, in addition to collecting my notes, I want this to be a place for daily entries, that include getting more in-depth with my <strong>/gratitude</strong> journal, and <strong>/foodlog</strong>, for starters–and having the project be on GitHub means I can simply create a new system with GitMinder that only tracks that repository.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, much more related to Beeminder, I've been having trouble with URLminder. Currently, <a href=\"https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/mornning-pages2\"><strong>/morningpages2</strong></a> is kind of just stuck at around 4,300 words for some reason–maybe I just input the Google Doc link incorrectly. I also had to sadly archive <strong>/typing</strong>, since I couldn't get my TypeRacer games to sync, but that was a just-for-fun goal anyways.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Trying to get into APIs last week ended up snowballing into a new project of it's own: <a href=\"https://selfteach.academy/\"><strong>SelfTeach.Academy</strong></a>. I don't think there'd be enough interest to try to make this a reality, though.</p>\n\n</div><div class=\"row\" id=\"author\">\n        <!-- <div class=\"col-xl-3 col-12\">\n            <img src=\"https://brennanbrown.ca/img/avatar.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail d-block mx-auto\"/>\n        </div> -->\n        <div class=\"col-xl-9 col-12\" id=\"author-text\">\n            <h2 class=\"text-lg-left text-center\">\n                About\n                DonGato\n            </h2>\n            <p>\n                A digital nomad.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div><!-- BACKLINKS --><!-- RELATED POSTS --></article></div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n                <button class=\"scroll-to-top\" id=\"scroll-to-top\">\n                    UP <i class=\"fa fa-chevron-up\"></i>\n                </button>\n            </div>\n        </main>\n        <!-- FOOTER -->\n<footer class=\"page-footer font-small blue\" id=\"footer\">\n    <div class=\"container-fluid text-sm-left\">\n        <div class=\"row\">\n            <div class=\"col-sm-6 mt-sm-0 my-3\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-uppercase text-center\">About\n                    The Blacklist</h2>\n                <p class=\"text-justify text-white mx-3\">\n                    <small>The phrase \"digital garden\" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating.</small>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"col-sm-3 col-6 mb-sm-0 mb-1\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-uppercase\">Directory</h2>\n                <ul class=\"list-unstyled\">\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"/home\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-home\"></i>\n                            Home Page</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"/about\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-signature\"></i>\n                            About</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"/posts\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-flag\"></i>\n                            Blog Posts</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"/feeds\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-rss-square\"></i>\n                            RSS Feeds</a>\n                    </li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"col-sm-3 col-6 mb-sm-0 mb-1\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-uppercase\">Other Places</h2>\n                <ul class=\"list-unstyled\">\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"https://github.com/don-gato-coded\">\n                            <i class=\"fab fa-github\"></i>\n                            GitHub</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/miblanco04\">\n                            <i class=\"fab fa-twitter\"></i>\n                            Twitter</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-briefcase\"></i>\n                            Portfolio</a>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <a href=\"mailto:don-gato-coded@gmail.com\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-envelope\"></i>\n                            E-mail</a>\n                    </li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footer-copyright text-center py-1 px-5\">\n        Source Code licensed\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/brennanbrown/enjoyment-work/blob/master/LICENSE\">MIT</a>\n        2025.\n        <br/>\n        Website content licensed\n        <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a>\n        |\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/brennanbrown/enjoyment-work\">\n            View Source Code\n        </a>\n\n    </div>\n</footer>\n\n        <!-- SCRIPTS -->\n<script>\n  document\n    .getElementById(\"scroll-to-top\")\n    .addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n      window.scrollTo({\n        top: 0,\n        left: 0,\n        behavior: \"smooth\",\n      });\n    });\n</script>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    window.MathJax = {\n        tex: {\n            packages: [\"base\", \"ams\"]\n        },\n        loader: {\n            load: [\"ui/menu\", \"[tex]/ams\"]\n        }\n    };\n</script>\n\n<script async id=\"MathJax-script\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-chtml.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n\n<script defer src=\"/assets/js/main.js\"></script>\n\n    </body>\n</html>","excerpt":"<p>Yet <em>another</em> busy bee-week.

I've been spending more time on the forums and getting more into the weeds of things, which has been fun!</p>\n\n<p>I realize now, at this point, I have ±10 beemergencies a day. This is by design, as it pushes me to actually get my daily tasks done.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn't really work for bigger tasks I have, like blog posts, where sometimes I try to just create something the last day instead of utilizing the whole week for it. I'm not really sure how to intelligently segment something like writing an article in a way that fits into how I use Beeminder.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"systems-updates\">Systems Updates</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/distraction\"><strong>/distraction:</strong></a> Cleaned up the graph's jagged ups-and-downs in the road editor. I also changed the rules on RescueTime to be more strict with what's considered distracting so I waste less time on the computer.</li>\n  <li>In general, I changed the views of a few older goals that I created back in 2017 to see their full range, rather than just when I restarted them. (Eg. <a href=\"https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/productivity\">/productivity</a> and <a href=\"https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/french\">/french</a>. I hope this increased context helps provide better understanding. Similarly, I've made data points public where applicable.</li>\n  <li>I also <em>still</em> need to find a new solution to <a href=\"https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/morning-pages\">/morning-pages</a>, and this is my verbal contract to myself I'll have that corrected before next week's post.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I finally took a gander at <a href=\"https://beemind.me\">beemind.me</a> for new ideas, and I'll be going over the integrations megalist (now that I know it exists, hah) this week to see what else I can add.</p>\n\n<p>My rule of thumb for new systems is this, I'll add it to my already large list of beemindings if I find a way to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Automatically track what I already to.</li>\n  <li>Automatically track something I really want to start doing.</li>\n  <li>Automatically track something that's fun and takes less than five minutes (see /typing).</li>\n  <li>Or, manually tracking something I <em>need</em> to start doing.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-systems\">New Systems</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/meta\"><strong>/meta:</strong></a> I've been trying to figure out what my meta goal should be for awhile, and I think tracking the daily cumulative data points from my other systems fits. It's definitely more interesting/fun than helpful right now, but why not?</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/typing\"><strong>/typing:</strong></a> I love typing games, and have been using <a href=\"https://www.keyhero.com/profile/brennanbrown\">KeyHero</a> forever, so why not give TypeRacer a try! Only problem is that it isn't working. :( No matter what I do, I get a \"Could not fetch scores.\" for the value.

I've been spending more time on the forums and getting more into the weeds of things, which has been fun!</p>\n","draft":false,"layout":"post","content-type":"journals","author":"Brennan K. Brown","slug":"October-6th-2020","ext":".md"},"content":"<p>Not really as busy with Beeminder this week! I've mostly been really busy with my new Jekyll digital garden project (which you can preview <a href=\"https://enjoymentwork.netlify.app\">here</a> if you're curious). It's crazy how many useful rabbit holes I've gone down in research, and with the serendipitous benefit of having the project's purpose be to archive and organize such rabbit holes!</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, sticking with Beeminder, I've noticed that <strong>/meditation</strong> seems a little selective with which \"mindful minutes\" it adds as data points–if it's a new medtiation from Headspace I haven't done before then it's added, but if it's one that I've already done then it doesn't seem to count it. I've noticed the iOS application updated though, so maybe it was just an anomaly.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I think the reason things were weird with URLminder reading from Google Docs was simply because I didn't set the privacy settings for the document correctly, whoops. Seems to be working now! I know it's been forever since I initially started with this goal–and I haven't really needed it since I've started a devlog on Draft that I plan to migrate–but I think it's still worth finally implementing correctly.</p>\n\n<p>I've been fumbling hard with <strong>/distraction</strong> lately. I've been derailing due to incorrect labeling of different websites I've been visiting, and it doesn't update like other systems do, to the point where it's 11:50 and it's still orange because it hasn't updated (and I know I shouldn't be in front of a screen that late, but that's another issue that needs to be tackled), which is a problem since it's a do-less goal.</p>\n\n<p>The simple solution to this is to just visit the RescueTime dashboard one per evening to make sure that the obscure sites I'm visiting are correctly labelled and that I'm not going over my unproductive screen-time limit.</p>\n","tags":[],"relative_path":"_journals/October-27th-2020.md","path":"_journals/October-27th-2020.md","date":"2025-05-23 17:20:32 -0400","output":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html

I've mostly been really busy with my new Jekyll digital garden project (which you can preview <a href=\"https://enjoymentwork.netlify.app\">here</a> if you're curious). It's crazy how many useful rabbit holes I've gone down in research, and with the serendipitous benefit of having the project's purpose be to archive and organize such rabbit holes!</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, sticking with Beeminder, I've noticed that <strong>/meditation</strong> seems a little selective with which \"mindful minutes\" it adds as data points–if it's a new medtiation from Headspace I haven't done before then it's added, but if it's one that I've already done then it doesn't seem to count it. I've noticed the iOS application updated though, so maybe it was just an anomaly.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I think the reason things were weird with URLminder reading from Google Docs was simply because I didn't set the privacy settings for the document correctly, whoops. Seems to be working now! I know it's been forever since I initially started with this goal–and I haven't really needed it since I've started a devlog on Draft that I plan to migrate–but I think it's still worth finally implementing correctly.</p>\n\n<p>I've been fumbling hard with <strong>/distraction</strong> lately. I've been derailing due to incorrect labeling of different websites I've been visiting, and it doesn't update like other systems do, to the point where it's 11:50 and it's still orange because it hasn't updated (and I know I shouldn't be in front of a screen that late, but that's another issue that needs to be tackled), which is a problem since it's a do-less goal.</p>\n\n<p>The simple solution to this is to just visit the RescueTime dashboard one per evening to make sure that the obscure sites I'm visiting are correctly labelled and that I'm not going over my unproductive

I've mostly been really busy with my new Jekyll digital garden project (which you can preview <a href=\"https://enjoymentwork.netlify.app\">here</a> if you're curious). It's crazy how many useful rabbit holes I've gone down in research, and with the serendipitous benefit of having the project's purpose be to archive and organize such rabbit holes!</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, sticking with Beeminder, I've noticed that <strong>/meditation</strong> seems a little selective with which \"mindful minutes\" it adds as data points–if it's a new medtiation from Headspace I haven't done before then it's added, but if it's one that I've already done then it doesn't seem to count it. I've noticed the iOS application updated though, so maybe it was just an anomaly.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I think the reason things were weird with URLminder reading from Google Docs was simply because I didn't set the privacy settings for the document correctly, whoops. Seems to be working now! I know it's been forever since I initially started with this goal–and I haven't really needed it since I've started a devlog on Draft that I plan to migrate–but I think it's still worth finally implementing correctly.</p>\n\n<p>I've been fumbling hard with <strong>/distraction</strong> lately. I've been derailing due to incorrect labeling of different websites I've been visiting, and it doesn't update like other systems do, to the point where it's 11:50 and it's still orange because it hasn't updated (and I know I shouldn't be in front of a screen that late, but that's another issue that needs to be tackled), which is a problem since it's a do-less goal.</p>\n\n<p>The simple solution to this is to just visit the RescueTime dashboard one per evening to make sure that the obscure sites I'm visiting are correctly labelled and that I'm not going over my unproductive screen-time limit.</p>\n\n</div><div class=\"row\" id=\"author\">\n        <!-- <div class=\"col-xl-3 col-12\">\n            <img src=\"https://brennanbrown.ca/img/avatar.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail

I've been spending more time on the forums and getting more into the weeds of things, which has been fun!</p>\n\n<p>I realize now, at this point, I have ±10 beemergencies a day. This is by design, as it pushes me to actually get my daily tasks done.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn't really work for bigger tasks I have, like blog posts, where sometimes I try to just create something the last day instead of utilizing the whole week for it. I'm not really sure how to intelligently segment something like writing an article in a way that fits into how I use Beeminder.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"systems-updates\">Systems Updates</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/distraction\"><strong>/distraction:</strong></a> Cleaned up the graph's jagged ups-and-downs in the road editor. I also changed the rules on RescueTime to be more strict with what's considered distracting so I waste less time on the computer.</li>\n  <li>In general, I changed the views of a few older goals that I created back in 2017 to see their full range, rather than just when I restarted them. (Eg. <a href=\"https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/productivity\">/productivity</a> and <a href=\"https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/french\">/french</a>. I hope this increased context helps provide better understanding. Similarly, I've made data points public where applicable.</li>\n  <li>I also <em>still</em> need to find a new solution to <a href=\"https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/morning-pages\">/morning-pages</a>, and this is my verbal contract to myself I'll have that corrected before next week's post.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I finally took a gander at <a href=\"https://beemind.me\">beemind.me</a> for new ideas, and I'll be going over the integrations megalist (now that I know it exists, hah) this week to see what else I can add.</p>\n\n<p>My rule of thumb for new systems is this, I'll add it to my already large list of beemindings if I find a way to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Automatically track what I already to.</li>\n  <li>Automatically track something I really want to start doing.</li>\n  <li>Automatically track something that's fun and takes less than five minutes (see /typing).</li>\n  <li>Or, manually tracking something I <em>need</em> to start doing.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-systems\">New Systems</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/meta\"><strong>/meta:</strong></a> I've been trying to figure out what my meta goal should be for awhile, and I think tracking the daily cumulative data points from my other systems fits. It's definitely more interesting/fun than helpful right now, but why not?</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/typing\"><strong>/typing:</strong></a> I love typing games, and have been using <a href=\"https://www.keyhero.com/profile/brennanbrown\">KeyHero</a> forever, so why not give TypeRacer a try! Only problem is that it isn't working. :( No matter what I do, I get a \"Could not fetch scores.\" for the value.

Take any essay by Orwell from [[As I Please::<a href=\"https://www.orwell.ru/library/articles/As_I_Please/english/\">https://www.orwell.ru/library/articles/As_I_Please/english/</a>]] during his time in The Tribune, or his other [[essays::<a href=\"https://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/index_en\">https://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/index_en</a>]].</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Apart from the quirky and chirpy attitude, what makes this this [[Application to New Yorker for a Job::<a href=\"https://fs.blog/2014/05/eudora-welty-to-the-new-yorker-the-best-job-application-ever/\">https://fs.blog/2014/05/eudora-welty-to-the-new-yorker-the-best-job-application-ever/</a>]] by Eudora Welty so memorable in my opinion is her use of common social artefacts like subtle mention of her background and its significance in how it relates to her being in this position right now;</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"boxit serif small-medium\">\n  <p>…I am 23 years old, six weeks on the loose in N.Y. However, I was a New Yorker for a whole year in 1930– 31 while attending advertising classes in Columbia’s School of Business. Actually I am a southerner, from Mississippi, the nation’s most backward state. Ramifications include Walter H. Page, who, unluckily for me, is no longer connected with Doubleday-Page, which is no longer Doubleday-Page, even. I have a B.A. (’ 29) from the University of Wisconsin, where I majored in English without a care in the world. For the last eighteen months I was languishing in my own office in a radio station in Jackson, Miss., writing continuities, dramas, mule feed advertisements, santa claus talks, and life insurance playlets; now I have given that up….</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The witty use of what I like to call a socio-cultural confabulation in the form of a movie review and a relatable but madeup word that is also original in a sense.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"boxit serif small-medium\">\n  <p>…As to what I might do for you— I have seen an untoward amount of picture galleries and 15¢ movies lately, and could review them with my old prosperous detachment, I think; in fact, I recently coined a general word for Matisse’s pictures after seeing his latest at the Marie Harriman: concubineapple. That shows you how my mind works—quick, and away from the point. I read simply voraciously, and can drum up an opinion afterwards…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The mention of India print and subtle showcase of how she knows the struggles in the industry without any explicit mention.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"boxit serif small-medium\">\n  <p>…Since I have bought an India print, and a large number of phonograph records from a Mr. Nussbaum who picks them up, and a Cezanne Bathers one inch long (that shows you I read e. e. cummings I hope), I am anxious to have an apartment, not to mention a small portable phonograph. How I would like to work for you! A little paragraph each morning— a little paragraph each night, if you can’t hire me from daylight to dark, although I would work like a slave. I can also draw like Mr. Thurber, in case he goes off the deep end. I have studied flower painting…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the final invocation of the extremely common social contruct i.e., <strong><em>the leprechaun throw.</em></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"boxit serif small-medium\">\n  <p>There is no telling where I may apply, if you turn me down; I realize this will not phase you, but consider my other alternative: the U of N.C. offers for $12.00 to let me dance in Vachel Lindsay’s Congo. I congo on. I rest my case, repeating that I am a hard worker.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This may not have been the best application in a formal sense, but the reason people go to it is probably because what it reminds them of — the cultural nostalgia (the shared social artefact).</p>\n\n<p>Another type of common artefact is sincere immitation of great works, the sincere admiration can help with the remembrance. Related: [[Sincere imitation is authentic]]</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"addendum\">Addendum</h3>\n\n<p>Incorporation of common artefacts might also help with remebering and understanding it easily when you read them years later. To put it succintly, it help you [[Write so your future self can remember]]</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n\n<p>Orwell, George.

However, I was a New Yorker for a whole year in 1930– 31 while attending advertising classes in Columbia’s School of Business. Actually I am a southerner, from Mississippi, the nation’s most backward state. Ramifications include Walter H. Page, who, unluckily for me, is no longer connected with Doubleday-Page, which is no longer Doubleday-Page, even. I have a B.A. (’ 29) from the University of Wisconsin, where I majored in English without a care in the world. For the last eighteen months I was languishing in my own office in a radio station in Jackson, Miss., writing continuities, dramas, mule feed advertisements, santa claus talks, and life insurance playlets; now I have given that up….</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The witty use of what I like to call a socio-cultural confabulation in the form of a movie review and a relatable but madeup word that is also original in a sense.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"boxit serif small-medium\">\n  <p>…As to what I might do for you— I have seen an untoward amount of picture galleries and 15¢ movies lately, and could review them with my old prosperous detachment, I think; in fact, I recently coined a general word for Matisse’s pictures after seeing his latest at the Marie Harriman: concubineapple. That shows you how my mind works—quick, and away from the point. I read simply voraciously, and can drum up an opinion afterwards…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The mention of India print and subtle showcase of how she knows the struggles in the industry without any explicit mention.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"boxit serif small-medium\">\n  <p>…Since I have bought an India print, and a large number of phonograph records from a Mr. Nussbaum who picks them up, and a Cezanne Bathers one inch long (that shows you I read e. e. cummings I hope), I am anxious to have an apartment, not to mention a small portable phonograph. How I would like to work for you! A little paragraph each morning— a little paragraph each night, if you can’t hire me from daylight to dark, although I would work like a slave. I can also draw like Mr. Thurber, in case he goes off the deep end. I have studied flower painting…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the final invocation of the extremely common social contruct i.e., <strong><em>the leprechaun throw.</em></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"boxit serif small-medium\">\n  <p>There is no telling where I may apply, if you turn me down; I realize this will not phase you, but consider my other alternative: the U of N.C. offers for $12.00 to let me dance in Vachel Lindsay’s Congo. I congo on. I rest my case, repeating that I am a hard worker.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This may not have been the best application in a formal sense, but the reason people go to it is probably because what it reminds them of — the cultural nostalgia (the shared social artefact).</p>\n\n<p>Another type of common artefact is sincere immitation of great works, the sincere admiration can help with the remembrance. Related: <a style=\"background-color:#ffffc4;\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">Sincere imitation is authentic</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"addendum\">Addendum</h3>\n\n<p>Incorporation of common artefacts might also help with remebering and understanding it easily when you read them years later.

My hypothesis is this is primarily due to cognitive exhaustion like sleep deprivation, burn-out, stress etc (Extrapolating from n=1), which due to implicity conformity and [[preference falsification::<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_falsification\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_falsification</a>]] has become a normative social element. My experience has been that when I have had a bad last night sleep or stress due to office, I invariably am looking for less polarity, otherwise the dark on white seems more appealing to me both aesthetics wise and legibility wise. An extension of these could be that cognitive stress elevate the ocular stress like accomodative/refractive/convergence stress leading up to this, but I contest dark mode being the wide-spread personal/subjective preference.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n\n<p>Bauer, D., &amp; Cavonius, C., R.

Part of this has to do with light levels: with a bright display (white background) the iris closes a bit more, decreasing the effect of the \"deformed\" lens; with a dark display (black background) the iris opens to receive more light and the deformation of the lens creates a much fuzzier focus at the eye.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Raluca Budiu.

However, I was a New Yorker for a whole year in 1930– 31 while attending advertising classes in Columbia’s School of Business. Actually I am a southerner, from Mississippi, the nation’s most backward state. Ramifications include Walter H. Page, who, unluckily for me, is no longer connected with Doubleday-Page, which is no longer Doubleday-Page, even. I have a B.A. (’ 29) from the University of Wisconsin, where I majored in English without a care in the world. For the last eighteen months I was languishing in my own office in a radio station in Jackson, Miss., writing continuities, dramas, mule feed advertisements, santa claus talks, and life insurance playlets; now I have given that up….</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The witty use of what I like to call a socio-cultural confabulation in the form of a movie review and a relatable but madeup word that is also original in a sense.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"boxit serif small-medium\">\n  <p>…As to what I might do for you— I have seen an untoward amount of picture galleries and 15¢ movies lately, and could review them with my old prosperous detachment, I think; in fact, I recently coined a general word for Matisse’s pictures after seeing his latest at the Marie Harriman: concubineapple. That shows you how my mind works—quick, and away from the point. I read simply voraciously, and can drum up an opinion afterwards…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The mention of India print and subtle showcase of how she knows the struggles in the industry without any explicit mention.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"boxit serif small-medium\">\n  <p>…Since I have bought an India print, and a large number of phonograph records from a Mr. Nussbaum who picks them up, and a Cezanne Bathers one inch long (that shows you I read e. e. cummings I hope), I am anxious to have an apartment, not to mention a small portable phonograph. How I would like to work for you! A little paragraph each morning— a little paragraph each night, if you can’t hire me from daylight to dark, although I would work like a slave. I can also draw like Mr. Thurber, in case he goes off the deep end. I have studied flower painting…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the final invocation of the extremely common social contruct i.e., <strong><em>the leprechaun throw.</em></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"boxit serif small-medium\">\n  <p>There is no telling where I may apply, if you turn me down; I realize this will not phase you, but consider my other alternative: the U of N.C. offers for $12.00 to let me dance in Vachel Lindsay’s Congo. I congo on. I rest my case, repeating that I am a hard worker.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This may not have been the best application in a formal sense, but the reason people go to it is probably because what it reminds them of — the cultural nostalgia (the shared social artefact).</p>\n\n<p>Another type of common artefact is sincere immitation of great works, the sincere admiration can help with the remembrance.

Take any essay by Orwell from <a href=\"<a href=\"https://www.orwell.ru/library/articles/As_I_Please/english/\">https://www.orwell.ru/library/articles/As_I_Please/english/</a>\">As I Please</a> during his time in The Tribune, or his other <a href=\"<a href=\"https://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/index_en\">https://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/index_en</a>\">essays</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Apart from the quirky and chirpy attitude, what makes this this <a href=\"<a href=\"https://fs.blog/2014/05/eudora-welty-to-the-new-yorker-the-best-job-application-ever/\">https://fs.blog/2014/05/eudora-welty-to-the-new-yorker-the-best-job-application-ever/</a>\">Application to New Yorker for a Job</a> by Eudora Welty so memorable in my opinion is her use of common social artefacts like subtle mention of her background and its significance in how it relates to her being in this position right now;</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"boxit serif small-medium\">\n  <p>…I am 23 years old, six weeks on the loose in N.Y. However, I was a New Yorker for a whole year in 1930– 31 while attending advertising classes in Columbia’s School of Business. Actually I am a southerner, from Mississippi, the nation’s most backward state. Ramifications include Walter H. Page, who, unluckily for me, is no longer connected with Doubleday-Page, which is no longer Doubleday-Page, even. I have a B.A. (’ 29) from the University of Wisconsin, where I majored in English without a care in the world. For the last eighteen months I was languishing in my own office in a radio station in Jackson, Miss., writing continuities, dramas, mule feed advertisements, santa claus talks, and life insurance playlets; now I have given that up….</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The witty use of what I like to call a socio-cultural confabulation in the form of a movie review and a relatable but madeup word that is also original in a sense.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"boxit serif small-medium\">\n  <p>…As to what I might do for you— I have seen an untoward amount of picture galleries and 15¢ movies lately, and could review them with my old prosperous detachment, I think; in fact, I recently coined a general word for Matisse’s pictures after seeing his latest at the Marie Harriman: concubineapple. That shows you how my mind works—quick, and away from the point. I read simply voraciously, and can drum up an opinion afterwards…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The mention of India print and subtle showcase of how she knows the struggles in the industry without any explicit mention.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"boxit serif small-medium\">\n  <p>…Since I have bought an India print, and a large number of phonograph records from a Mr. Nussbaum who picks them up, and a Cezanne Bathers one inch long (that shows you I read e. e. cummings I hope), I am anxious to have an apartment, not to mention a small portable phonograph. How I would like to work for you! A little paragraph each morning— a little paragraph each night, if you can’t hire me from daylight to dark, although I would work like a slave. I can also draw like Mr. Thurber, in case he goes off the deep end. I have studied flower painting…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the final invocation of the extremely common social contruct i.e., <strong><em>the leprechaun throw.</em></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"boxit serif small-medium\">\n  <p>There is no telling where I may apply, if you turn me down; I realize this will not phase you, but consider my other alternative: the U of N.C. offers for $12.00 to let me dance in Vachel Lindsay’s Congo. I congo on. I rest my case, repeating that I am a hard worker.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This may not have been the best application in a formal sense, but the reason people go to it is probably because what it reminds them of — the cultural nostalgia (the shared social artefact).</p>\n\n<p>Another type of common artefact is sincere immitation of great works, the sincere admiration can help with the remembrance. Related: <a style=\"background-color:#ffffc4;\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">Sincere imitation is authentic</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"addendum\">Addendum</h3>\n\n<p>Incorporation of common artefacts might also help with remebering and understanding it easily when you read them years later. To put it succintly, it help you <a style=\"background-color:#ffffc4;\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">Write so your future self can remember</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n\n<p>Orwell, George.

However, I was a New Yorker for a whole year in 1930– 31 while attending advertising classes in Columbia’s School of Business. Actually I am a southerner, from Mississippi, the nation’s most backward state. Ramifications include Walter H. Page, who, unluckily for me, is no longer connected with Doubleday-Page, which is no longer Doubleday-Page, even. I have a B.A. (’ 29) from the University of Wisconsin, where I majored in English without a care in the world. For the last eighteen months I was languishing in my own office in a radio station in Jackson, Miss., writing continuities, dramas, mule feed advertisements, santa claus talks, and life insurance playlets; now I have given that up….</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The witty use of what I like to call a socio-cultural confabulation in the form of a movie review and a relatable but madeup word that is also original in a sense.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"boxit serif small-medium\">\n  <p>…As to what I might do for you— I have seen an untoward amount of picture galleries and 15¢ movies lately, and could review them with my old prosperous detachment, I think; in fact, I recently coined a general word for Matisse’s pictures after seeing his latest at the Marie Harriman: concubineapple. That shows you how my mind works—quick, and away from the point. I read simply voraciously, and can drum up an opinion afterwards…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The mention of India print and subtle showcase of how she knows the struggles in the industry without any explicit mention.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"boxit serif small-medium\">\n  <p>…Since I have bought an India print, and a large number of phonograph records from a Mr. Nussbaum who picks them up, and a Cezanne Bathers one inch long (that shows you I read e. e. cummings I hope), I am anxious to have an apartment, not to mention a small portable phonograph. How I would like to work for you! A little paragraph each morning— a little paragraph each night, if you can’t hire me from daylight to dark, although I would work like a slave. I can also draw like Mr. Thurber, in case he goes off the deep end. I have studied flower painting…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the final invocation of the extremely common social contruct i.e., <strong><em>the leprechaun throw.</em></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"boxit serif small-medium\">\n  <p>There is no telling where I may apply, if you turn me down; I realize this will not phase you, but consider my other alternative: the U of N.C. offers for $12.00 to let me dance in Vachel Lindsay’s Congo. I congo on. I rest my case, repeating that I am a hard worker.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This may not have been the best application in a formal sense, but the reason people go to it is probably because what it reminds them of — the cultural nostalgia (the shared social artefact).</p>\n\n<p>Another type of common artefact is sincere immitation of great works, the sincere admiration can help with the remembrance. Related: [[Sincere imitation is authentic]]</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"addendum\">Addendum</h3>\n\n<p>Incorporation of common artefacts might also help with remebering and understanding it easily when you read them years later.

your epistemic confidence i.e., you (can) only know so much::rmn]], that is required of the subject in hand, in your writing. My observation has been that writing essays involve introduction of at least some amount of ontological dust that sprouts from past vague encounters or influences that you cannot remember.

Google claims in its [[android developer guide that dark themes can improve visibility for people who have low vision and are sensititive to brightness::<a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/darktheme\">https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/darktheme</a>]], but people I have spoken to on this topic (n≈20) had normal vision and normal range of sensitivity to light.</p>\n\n<p>Even people with mild eye issues[[Jason Harrison, UBC - People with astigmatism (approximately 50% of the population) find it harder to read white text on black than black text on white.::lsn]] seem to benefit from light theme than dark theme in most cases. And to top it all, even the researches that focus on the legibility[[Bauer, D., &amp; Cavonius, C., R. (1980). <em>Improving the legibility of visual display units through contrast reversal.</em> <br /><strong>See Below for more</strong>.::rsn]] and aesthetics claim that dark on light is almost always better than dark on light. Every article I have read and referenced below vouch for dark on light, which I find to be true too at least in most occasions.</p>\n\n<p>How can what is relatively bad for legibility in most ocassions, bad in terms of expressibility of authorial aesthetics be a wide-spread preference? My hypothesis is this is primarily due to cognitive exhaustion like sleep deprivation, burn-out, stress etc (Extrapolating from n=1), which due to implicity conformity and [[preference falsification::<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_falsification\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_falsification</a>]] has become a normative social element. My experience has been that when I have had a bad last night sleep or stress due to office, I invariably am looking for less polarity, otherwise the dark on white seems more appealing to me both aesthetics wise and legibility wise. An extension of these could be that cognitive stress elevate the ocular stress like accomodative/refractive/convergence stress leading up to this, but I contest dark mode being the wide-spread personal/subjective preference.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n\n<p>Bauer, D., &amp; Cavonius, C., R.

Part of this has to do with light levels: with a bright display (white background) the iris closes a bit more, decreasing the effect of the \"deformed\" lens; with a dark display (black background) the iris opens to receive more light and the deformation of the lens creates a much fuzzier focus at the eye.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Raluca Budiu.

However, the difference between light mode and dark mode in the visual-acuity task was smaller for older adults than for younger adults — meaning that, although light mode was better for older adults, too, they did not benefit from it as much as younger adults, at least in the visual-acuity task.</p>\n\n  <p>When researchers looked at fatigue metrics, they concluded that there was no significant difference of contrast polarity on any of them (meaning that it wasn’t the case that dark mode made people more tired, or vice versa)…\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lauren V.

When you are working for an organization or working independently on a collaborative oss, the major chunk of your cognitive bandwidth gets allocated to those projects, which is not bad per-se, it does teach you how to work in a collaborative environment and to learn from people who are better at the concerned technology/concept than you. But the issue is more personal and emotional in when you are working on something bigger than you, it unwittingly causes a self-effacive effect i.e., you tend to devalue the emotional effects of being able to create something with complete autonomy, or crave for the autonomy and burnout as a result of the cognitive exhaustion. The sense of freedom and the liberating experience that comes out of the creative autonomy is just unmatched.</p>\n\n<p>Even a side-project in github that you consider to be trivial has an effect that only such kind of projects can provide, of having done everything yourself and without anyone putting constraints on what you can and what you can't. It allows you to experiment outside of what would be acceptable within a project you are doing with others. Something like what if I just re-wrote this entire engine on top of openGL would never (or almost never) make sense in a collaborative project, but it would make perfect sense if it is just you.</p>\n\n<p>The other obvious advantage is it makes you much more light-hearted because you know that if this doesn't work out the way I like it or good for me, then I can just go. When you are working on a personal project out of your own free will, it has a certain kind of air that a collaborative project won't. It is purely voluntary, and you can just up and leave at any time. That adds something to the mix. The responsibility of joy or stress that comes out of it suddenly becomes more tolerable as well as enjoyable.

When you are working for an organization or working independently on a collaborative oss, the major chunk of your cognitive bandwidth gets allocated to those projects, which is not bad per-se, it does teach you how to work in a collaborative environment and to learn from people who are better at the concerned technology/concept than you. But the issue is more personal and emotional in when you are working on something bigger than you, it unwittingly causes a self-effacive effect i.e., you tend to devalue the emotional effects of being able to create something with complete autonomy, or crave for the autonomy and burnout as a result of the cognitive exhaustion. The sense of freedom and the liberating experience that comes out of the creative autonomy is just unmatched.</p>\n\n<p>Even a side-project in github that you consider to be trivial has an effect that only such kind of projects can provide, of having done everything yourself and without anyone putting constraints on what you can and what you can't. It allows you to experiment outside of what would be acceptable within a project you are doing with others. Something like what if I just re-wrote this entire engine on top of openGL would never (or almost never) make sense in a collaborative project, but it would make perfect sense if it is just you.</p>\n\n<p>The other obvious advantage is it makes you much more light-hearted because you know that if this doesn't work out the way I like it or good for me, then I can just go. When you are working on a personal project out of your own free will, it has a certain kind of air that a collaborative project won't. It is purely voluntary, and you can just up and leave at any time. That adds something to the mix. The responsibility of joy or stress that comes out of it suddenly becomes more tolerable as well as enjoyable. Note that I am not advocating that you drop everything that you don't like, it is just that having certain things in your life that you can control can help handle that which you can't.</p>\n\n<p>Related: <a style=\"background-color:#ffffc4;\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">Creativity is a quality without a name</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n\n<p>Andreas Kling.

When you are working for an organization or working independently on a collaborative oss, the major chunk of your cognitive bandwidth gets allocated to those projects, which is not bad per-se, it does teach you how to work in a collaborative environment and to learn from people who are better at the concerned technology/concept than you. But the issue is more personal and emotional in when you are working on something bigger than you, it unwittingly causes a self-effacive effect i.e., you tend to devalue the emotional effects of being able to create something with complete autonomy, or crave for the autonomy and burnout as a result of the cognitive exhaustion. The sense of freedom and the liberating experience that comes out of the creative autonomy is just unmatched.</p>\n\n<p>Even a side-project in github that you consider to be trivial has an effect that only such kind of projects can provide, of having done everything yourself and without anyone putting constraints on what you can and what you can't. It allows you to experiment outside of what would be acceptable within a project you are doing with others. Something like what if I just re-wrote this entire engine on top of openGL would never (or almost never) make sense in a collaborative project, but it would make perfect sense if it is just you.</p>\n\n<p>The other obvious advantage is it makes you much more light-hearted because you know that if this doesn't work out the way I like it or good for me, then I can just go. When you are working on a personal project out of your own free will, it has a certain kind of air that a collaborative project won't. It is purely voluntary, and you can just up and leave at any time. That adds something to the mix. The responsibility of joy or stress that comes out of it suddenly becomes more tolerable as well as enjoyable. Note that I am not advocating that you drop everything that you don't like, it is just that having certain things in your life that you can control can help handle that which you can't.</p>\n\n<p>Related: [[Creativity is a quality without a name]]</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n\n<p>Andreas Kling.

When you are working for an organization or working independently on a collaborative oss, the major chunk of your cognitive bandwidth gets allocated to those projects, which is not bad per-se, it does teach you how to work in a collaborative environment and to learn from people who are better at the concerned technology/concept than you. But the issue is more personal and emotional in when you are working on something bigger than you, it unwittingly causes a self-effacive effect i.e., you tend to devalue the emotional effects of being able to create something with complete autonomy, or crave for the autonomy and burnout as a result of the cognitive exhaustion. The sense of freedom and the liberating experience that comes out of the creative autonomy is just unmatched.</p>\n\n<p>Even a side-project in github that you consider to be trivial has an effect that only such kind of projects can provide, of having done everything yourself and without anyone putting constraints on what you can and what you can't. It allows you to experiment outside of what would be acceptable within a project you are doing with others. Something like what if I just re-wrote this entire engine on top of openGL would never (or almost never) make sense in a collaborative project, but it would make perfect sense if it is just you.</p>\n\n<p>The other obvious advantage is it makes you much more light-hearted because you know that if this doesn't work out the way I like it or good for me, then I can just go. When you are working on a personal project out of your own free will, it has a certain kind of air that a collaborative project won't. It is purely voluntary, and you can just up and leave at any time. That adds something to the mix. The responsibility of joy or stress that comes out of it suddenly becomes more tolerable as well as enjoyable. Note that I am not advocating that you drop everything that you don't like, it is just that having certain things in your life that you can control can help handle that which you can't.</p>\n\n<p>Related: <a style=\"background-color:#ffffc4;\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">Creativity is a quality without a name</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n\n<p>Andreas Kling.

issues like will-power dissolution, decision fatigue, burn-out, guilt etc owing to the disincentives of self-enforced adherence to an idea/project for a long term. This is based on the idea by Kurzban et. al that overcommiting to a task, that is only expected to show its result in distant future, can dissolve will power to an extent of a burnout or complete unproductivity.

They don’t schedule endless back-to-back meetings. They avoid temptations like all-you-can-eat buffets, and they establish habits that eliminate the mental effort of making choices. Instead of deciding every morning whether or not to force themselves to exercise, they set up regular appointments to work out with a friend. Instead of counting on willpower to remain robust all day, they conserve it so that it’s available for emergencies and important decisions….’Even the wisest people won’t make good choices when they’re not rested and their glucose is low,’ Baumeister points out. That’s why the truly wise don’t restructure the company at 4 p.m. They don’t make major commitments during the cocktail hour. And if a decision must be made late in the day, they know not to do it on an empty stomach. ‘The best decision makers,’ Baumeister says, ‘are the ones who know when not to trust themselves.’…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Conversation with [[Gwern Branwen::https://twitter.com/gwern]].

This is based on the idea by Kurzban et. al that overcommiting to a task, that is only expected to show its result in distant future, can dissolve will power to an extent of a burnout or complete unproductivity. And in my opinion, it not just affects the quantifiable components, it also affects your qualitative components like creative autonomy.</p>\n\n<p>After talking with few interesting people and trying out various different processes myself I have come to the conclusion that some of the strategies mentioned below can help in persistance of motivation in a long term personal project without any unnatural self-enforced adherence.

They don’t schedule endless back-to-back meetings. They avoid temptations like all-you-can-eat buffets, and they establish habits that eliminate the mental effort of making choices. Instead of deciding every morning whether or not to force themselves to exercise, they set up regular appointments to work out with a friend. Instead of counting on willpower to remain robust all day, they conserve it so that it’s available for emergencies and important decisions….’Even the wisest people won’t make good choices when they’re not rested and their glucose is low,’ Baumeister points out. That’s why the truly wise don’t restructure the company at 4 p.m. They don’t make major commitments during the cocktail hour. And if a decision must be made late in the day, they know not to do it on an empty stomach. ‘The best decision makers,’ Baumeister says, ‘are the ones who know when not to trust themselves.’…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Conversation with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gwern\">Gwern Branwen<sup ><i class=\"fa fa-twitter\"></i></sup></a>.

issues like will-power dissolution, decision fatigue, burn-out, guilt etc owing to the disincentives of self-enforced adherence to an idea/project for a long term. This is based on the idea by Kurzban et. al that overcommiting to a task, that is only expected to show its result in distant future, can dissolve will power to an extent of a burnout or complete unproductivity. And in my opinion, it not just affects the quantifiable components, it also affects your qualitative components like creative autonomy.</p>\n","draft":false,"layout":"post","content-type":"notes","slug":"serendipity-outlook","ext":".md"}]

Jack White to release a fully fledged range of <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/gear/best-signature-guitars\">signature guitar</a> products – including an accessible version of his wild custom TripleCaster <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/features/best-telecasters-fender-guitars\">Telecaster</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The sleek TripleCaster – which positions itself as the wildest Tele that Fender currently has on its books – is joined by White’s signature Pano Verb <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/features/best-guitar-amps\">guitar amp</a>, and the TripleSonic Acoustasonic Telecaster.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a significant move from both Fender and the White Stripes hero, with the former taking the unusual decision to unveil its entire family of new White signature products in one go, rather than rolling the range out piece by piece across an extended period.</p>\n\n<p>There are three items to get stuck into, but the TripleCaster obviously takes the headline. It is seemingly inspired by <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/news/jack-white-taking-me-back-live\">White’s very own Low Rider Telecaster</a> – one of the wildest Teles ever created, which <em>Guitar World</em> ’s Michael Astley-Brown <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/news/jack-white-fender-low-rider-namm-2024-demo\">took for a spin during NAMM</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It’s been a stalwart of White’s setup over the years, and features a bizarre spec sheet comprising a <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/gear/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-the-b-bender-a-guitarists-ultimate-secret-weapon\">B-Bender</a>, D-Tuna, custom trio of pickups, half-scalloped fretboard, and a whole host of electronic gizmos.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mV8SCsUysJcN32XJFAFfME.jpg\" alt=\"Fender Jack White Signature Collection\" /></p>\n\n<p>(Image credit: Fender)</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H3M-91tsvEo?si=zv-F93jMZUw3vv-r\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Of course, any signature replica would have to be significantly streamlined purely because of the finances and expertise involved in making such a wild instrument, but the TripleCaster does a valiant job of offering the highlights.</p>\n\n<p>That means the Piano Black-finished model offers a Jack White <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/features/best-humbucker-pickups\">humbucker</a>, JW-90 single-coil and White-voiced CuNiFe Wide-Range humbucker, as well as a <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/features/how-bigsby-vibratos-changed-guitar\">Bigsby</a> vibrato, a Hipshot Xtender DropTuner and a kill switch.</p>\n\n<p>So, you’re not exactly getting the Low Rider, but the TripleCaster looks to be a nice middle ground between White’s wild custom model and a stripped-back signature.</p>\n\n<p>It also sets a rather tantalizing precedent. Could we see similar recreations of White's other custom Fenders – such as <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/news/jack-white-custom-fender-jazzmaster-pitch-shifter\">his pitch-shifting Jazzmaster</a> – down the line?</p>\n\n<p>Image 1 of 3</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PfZotv2XkAhsQ5abrzWBJE.jpg\" alt=\"Fender Jack White Signature Collection TripleCaster Telecaster\" /></p>\n\n<p>(Image credit: Fender)</p>\n\n<p>The TripleCaster is joined by the TripleSonic – a Satin Black/Arctic White Acoustasonic that offers specs such as a Soft V neck shape (as opposed to the standard model’s Deep C Profile), a uniquely shaped pickguard and pickup voicings curated by White.</p>\n\n<p>This model also looks to be based on another guitar that has become a key player in White’s arsenal, namely the black burst Acoustasonic that he’s been spotted playing on various occasions – <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/news/jack-white-olympia-concert\">including a 2022 set in Paris</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Fender’s final offering from its Jack White signature collection is the Pano Verb. A combination of White’s Vintage Vibrasonic and Vibroverb amps, the Pano Verb offers “enhanced stereo reverb and tremolo effects”, and a unique 15” / 10” speaker combo.</p>\n\n<p>The amp itself is the result of four years of development between Fender and White, with the latter describing the Pano Verb as his vision of “the ultimate amplifier”. It is, apparently, unlike anything Fender has ever done before.</p>\n\n<p>These are all high-end products, so they’re priced accordingly. The Pano Verb and TripleCaster are available for $2,999, while the TripleSonic will have a price tag of $2,499.</p>\n\n<p>“We found the best of the old with the best of the new, and mixed innovation with the history of Fender, and did something we think maybe Leo Fender would be very proud of,” says White of his new collection.</p>\n\n<p>“Jack is regarded as a true visionary in the music world, and it has been an incredible journey working with him on developing these products,” adds Fender’s Justin Norvell. “This collection embodies the essence of what makes Jack White an icon, and we're proud to bring his vision to life for fans and musicians alike.”</p>\n\n<p>Visit <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1583087&amp;xcust=guitarworld_us_3653065299170489502&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fender.com%2F&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.guitarworld.com%2Fnews%2Ffender-jack-white-signature-collection\">Fender</a> for more information.</p>\n\n<p>This is White's first official drop with Fender, but it's by no means the first time he's worked with an outside company to produce some signature gear. Over the years, he and his Third Man Hardware brand have partnered with Donner for <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/reviews/third-man-hardware-x-donner-triple-threat\">the Triple Threat</a>, and more recently <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/news/third-man-hardware-anasounds-la-grotte\">worked with Anasounds to produced his ideal spring reverb pedal</a>.</p>\n","tags":["music","musicians","youtube"],"relative_path":"_posts/2025-05-21-jack-white.md","path":"_posts/2025-05-21-jack-white.md","date":"2025-05-21 00:00:00

It is seemingly inspired by <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/news/jack-white-taking-me-back-live\">White’s very own Low Rider Telecaster</a> – one of the wildest Teles ever created, which <em>Guitar World</em> ’s Michael Astley-Brown <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/news/jack-white-fender-low-rider-namm-2024-demo\">took for a spin during NAMM</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It’s been a stalwart of White’s setup over the years, and features a bizarre spec sheet comprising a <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/gear/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-the-b-bender-a-guitarists-ultimate-secret-weapon\">B-Bender</a>, D-Tuna, custom trio of pickups, half-scalloped fretboard, and a whole host of electronic gizmos.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mV8SCsUysJcN32XJFAFfME.jpg\" alt=\"Fender Jack White Signature Collection\" /></p>\n\n<p>(Image credit: Fender)</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H3M-91tsvEo?si=zv-F93jMZUw3vv-r\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Of course, any signature replica would have to be significantly streamlined purely because of the finances and expertise involved in making such a wild instrument, but the TripleCaster does a valiant job of offering the highlights.</p>\n\n<p>That means the Piano Black-finished model offers a Jack White <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/features/best-humbucker-pickups\">humbucker</a>, JW-90 single-coil and White-voiced CuNiFe Wide-Range humbucker, as well as a <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/features/how-bigsby-vibratos-changed-guitar\">Bigsby</a> vibrato, a Hipshot Xtender DropTuner and a kill switch.</p>\n\n<p>So, you’re not exactly getting the Low Rider, but the TripleCaster looks to be a nice middle ground between White’s wild custom model and a stripped-back signature.</p>\n\n<p>It also sets a rather tantalizing precedent. Could we see similar recreations of White's other custom Fenders – such as <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/news/jack-white-custom-fender-jazzmaster-pitch-shifter\">his pitch-shifting Jazzmaster</a> – down the line?</p>\n\n<p>Image 1 of 3</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PfZotv2XkAhsQ5abrzWBJE.jpg\" alt=\"Fender Jack White Signature Collection TripleCaster Telecaster\" /></p>\n\n<p>(Image credit: Fender)</p>\n\n<p>The TripleCaster is joined by the TripleSonic – a Satin Black/Arctic White Acoustasonic that offers specs such as a Soft V neck shape (as opposed to the standard model’s Deep C Profile), a uniquely shaped pickguard and pickup voicings curated by White.</p>\n\n<p>This model also looks to be based on another guitar that has become a key player in White’s arsenal, namely the black burst Acoustasonic that he’s been spotted playing on various occasions – <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/news/jack-white-olympia-concert\">including a 2022 set in Paris</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Fender’s final offering from its Jack White signature collection is the Pano Verb. A combination of White’s Vintage Vibrasonic and Vibroverb amps, the Pano Verb offers “enhanced stereo reverb and tremolo effects”, and a unique 15” / 10” speaker combo.</p>\n\n<p>The amp itself is the result of four years of development between Fender and White, with the latter describing the Pano Verb as his vision of “the ultimate amplifier”. It is, apparently, unlike anything Fender has ever done before.</p>\n\n<p>These are all high-end products, so they’re priced accordingly. The Pano Verb and TripleCaster are available for $2,999, while the TripleSonic will have a price tag of $2,499.</p>\n\n<p>“We found the best of the old with the best of the new, and mixed innovation with the history of Fender, and did something we think maybe Leo Fender would be very proud of,” says White of his new collection.</p>\n\n<p>“Jack is regarded as a true visionary in the music world, and it has been an incredible journey working with him on developing these products,” adds Fender’s Justin Norvell. “This collection embodies the essence of what makes Jack White an icon, and we're proud to bring his vision to life for fans and musicians alike.”</p>\n\n<p>Visit <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1583087&amp;xcust=guitarworld_us_3653065299170489502&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fender.com%2F&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.guitarworld.com%2Fnews%2Ffender-jack-white-signature-collection\">Fender</a> for more information.</p>\n\n<p>This is White's first official drop with Fender, but it's by no means the first time he's worked with an outside company to produce some signature gear. Over the years, he and his Third Man Hardware brand have partnered with Donner for <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/reviews/third-man-hardware-x-donner-triple-threat\">the Triple Threat</a>, and more recently <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/news/third-man-hardware-anasounds-la-grotte\">worked with Anasounds to produced his ideal spring reverb pedal</a>.</p>\n\n</div><div class=\"row\"

Jack White to release a fully fledged range of <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/gear/best-signature-guitars\">signature guitar</a> products – including an accessible version of his wild custom TripleCaster <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/features/best-telecasters-fender-guitars\">Telecaster</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The sleek TripleCaster – which positions itself as the wildest Tele that Fender currently has on its books – is joined by White’s signature Pano Verb <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/features/best-guitar-amps\">guitar amp</a>, and the TripleSonic Acoustasonic Telecaster.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a significant move from both Fender and the White Stripes hero, with the former taking the unusual decision to unveil its entire family of new White signature products in one go, rather than rolling the range out piece by piece across an extended period.</p>\n\n<p>There are three items to get stuck into, but the TripleCaster obviously takes the headline. It is seemingly inspired by <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/news/jack-white-taking-me-back-live\">White’s very own Low Rider Telecaster</a> – one of the wildest Teles ever created, which <em>Guitar World</em> ’s Michael Astley-Brown <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/news/jack-white-fender-low-rider-namm-2024-demo\">took for a spin during NAMM</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It’s been a stalwart of White’s setup over the years, and features a bizarre spec sheet comprising a <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/gear/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-the-b-bender-a-guitarists-ultimate-secret-weapon\">B-Bender</a>, D-Tuna, custom trio of pickups, half-scalloped fretboard, and a whole host of electronic gizmos.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mV8SCsUysJcN32XJFAFfME.jpg\" alt=\"Fender Jack White Signature Collection\" /></p>\n\n<p>(Image credit: Fender)</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H3M-91tsvEo?si=zv-F93jMZUw3vv-r\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Of course, any signature replica would have to be significantly streamlined purely because of the finances and expertise involved in making such a wild instrument, but the TripleCaster does a valiant job of offering the highlights.</p>\n\n<p>That means the Piano Black-finished model offers a Jack White <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/features/best-humbucker-pickups\">humbucker</a>, JW-90 single-coil and White-voiced CuNiFe Wide-Range humbucker, as well as a <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/features/how-bigsby-vibratos-changed-guitar\">Bigsby</a> vibrato, a Hipshot Xtender DropTuner and a kill switch.</p>\n\n<p>So, you’re not exactly getting the Low Rider, but the TripleCaster looks to be a nice middle ground between White’s wild custom model and a stripped-back signature.</p>\n\n<p>It also sets a rather tantalizing precedent. Could we see similar recreations of White's other custom Fenders – such as <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/news/jack-white-custom-fender-jazzmaster-pitch-shifter\">his pitch-shifting Jazzmaster</a> – down the line?</p>\n\n<p>Image 1 of 3</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PfZotv2XkAhsQ5abrzWBJE.jpg\" alt=\"Fender Jack White Signature Collection TripleCaster Telecaster\" /></p>\n\n<p>(Image credit: Fender)</p>\n\n<p>The TripleCaster is joined by the TripleSonic – a Satin Black/Arctic White Acoustasonic that offers specs such as a Soft V neck shape (as opposed to the standard model’s Deep C Profile), a uniquely shaped pickguard and pickup voicings curated by White.</p>\n\n<p>This model also looks to be based on another guitar that has become a key player in White’s arsenal, namely the black burst Acoustasonic that he’s been spotted playing on various occasions – <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/news/jack-white-olympia-concert\">including a 2022 set in Paris</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Fender’s final offering from its Jack White signature collection is the Pano Verb. A combination of White’s Vintage Vibrasonic and Vibroverb amps, the Pano Verb offers “enhanced stereo reverb and tremolo effects”, and a unique 15” / 10” speaker combo.</p>\n\n<p>The amp itself is the result of four years of development between Fender and White, with the latter describing the Pano Verb as his vision of “the ultimate amplifier”. It is, apparently, unlike anything Fender has ever done before.</p>\n\n<p>These are all high-end products, so they’re priced accordingly. The Pano Verb and TripleCaster are available for $2,999, while the TripleSonic will have a price tag of $2,499.</p>\n\n<p>“We found the best of the old with the best of the new, and mixed innovation with the history of Fender, and did something we think maybe Leo Fender would be very proud of,” says White of his new collection.</p>\n\n<p>“Jack is regarded as a true visionary in the music world, and it has been an incredible journey working with him on developing these products,” adds Fender’s Justin Norvell. “This collection embodies the essence of what makes Jack White an icon, and we're proud to bring his vision to life for fans and musicians alike.”</p>\n\n<p>Visit <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1583087&amp;xcust=guitarworld_us_3653065299170489502&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fender.com%2F&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.guitarworld.com%2Fnews%2Ffender-jack-white-signature-collection\">Fender</a> for more information.</p>\n\n<p>This is White's first official drop with Fender, but it's by no means the first time he's worked with an outside company to produce some signature gear. Over the years, he and his Third Man Hardware brand have partnered with Donner for <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/reviews/third-man-hardware-x-donner-triple-threat\">the Triple Threat</a>, and more recently <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/news/third-man-hardware-anasounds-la-grotte\">worked with Anasounds to produced his ideal spring reverb pedal</a>.</p>\n","tags":["music","musicians","youtube"],"relative_path":"_posts/2025-05-21-jack-white.md","path":"_posts/2025-05-21-jack-white.md","date":"2025-05-21 00:00:00

Could we see similar recreations of White's other custom Fenders – such as <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/news/jack-white-custom-fender-jazzmaster-pitch-shifter\">his pitch-shifting Jazzmaster</a> – down the line?</p>\n\n<p>Image 1 of 3</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PfZotv2XkAhsQ5abrzWBJE.jpg\" alt=\"Fender Jack White Signature Collection TripleCaster Telecaster\" /></p>\n\n<p>(Image credit: Fender)</p>\n\n<p>The TripleCaster is joined by the TripleSonic – a Satin Black/Arctic White Acoustasonic that offers specs such as a Soft V neck shape (as opposed to the standard model’s Deep C Profile), a uniquely shaped pickguard and pickup voicings curated by White.</p>\n\n<p>This model also looks to be based on another guitar that has become a key player in White’s arsenal, namely the black burst Acoustasonic that he’s been spotted playing on various occasions – <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/news/jack-white-olympia-concert\">including a 2022 set in Paris</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Fender’s final offering from its Jack White signature collection is the Pano Verb. A combination of White’s Vintage Vibrasonic and Vibroverb amps, the Pano Verb offers “enhanced stereo reverb and tremolo effects”, and a unique 15” / 10” speaker combo.</p>\n\n<p>The amp itself is the result of four years of development between Fender and White, with the latter describing the Pano Verb as his vision of “the ultimate amplifier”. It is, apparently, unlike anything Fender has ever done before.</p>\n\n<p>These are all high-end products, so they’re priced accordingly. The Pano Verb and TripleCaster are available for $2,999, while the TripleSonic will have a price tag of $2,499.</p>\n\n<p>“We found the best of the old with the best of the new, and mixed innovation with the history of Fender, and did something we think maybe Leo Fender would be very proud of,” says White of his new collection.</p>\n\n<p>“Jack is regarded as a true visionary in the music world, and it has been an incredible journey working with him on developing these products,” adds Fender’s Justin Norvell. “This collection embodies the essence of what makes Jack White an icon, and we're proud to bring his vision to life for fans and musicians alike.”</p>\n\n<p>Visit <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1583087&amp;xcust=guitarworld_us_3653065299170489502&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fender.com%2F&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.guitarworld.com%2Fnews%2Ffender-jack-white-signature-collection\">Fender</a> for more information.</p>\n\n<p>This is White's first official drop with Fender, but it's by no means the first time he's worked with an outside company to produce some signature gear. Over the years, he and his Third Man Hardware brand have partnered with Donner for <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/reviews/third-man-hardware-x-donner-triple-threat\">the Triple Threat</a>, and more recently <a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/news/third-man-hardware-anasounds-la-grotte\">worked with Anasounds to produced his ideal spring reverb pedal</a>.</p>\n\n</div><div class=\"row\"

but it’s not <em>not</em> a kiss. Her lips—full, soft, pliable—yield under mine, warm from the electric heating rod embedded in her throat. They taste of a faint chemical, like aspartame in Diet Pepsi. Her thermoplastic elastomer skin is sensitive to fabric dyes, so she wears white Agent Provocateur lingerie on white Ralph Lauren sateen sheets. I’ve prepped her body with Estée Lauder talcum, a detail I take pride in, to mimic the dry elasticity of real flesh. Her breathing quickens—a quiet pulse courtesy of Dyson Air technology. Beneath the TPE skin, her Boston Dynamics joint system gyrates softly. She’s in silent mode, so when I kiss her neck, her moan streams directly into my Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/02/14/1111382/robots-sex-doll-relationships-fiction-speculation-customer-service/\">My sex doll is mad at me: A fiction story - MIT Technology Review</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Leo Herrera is a writer and artist.

Her lips—full, soft, pliable—yield under mine, warm from the electric heating rod embedded in her throat. They taste of a faint chemical, like aspartame in Diet Pepsi. Her thermoplastic elastomer skin is sensitive to fabric dyes, so she wears white Agent Provocateur lingerie on white Ralph Lauren sateen sheets. I’ve prepped her body with Estée Lauder talcum, a detail I take pride in, to mimic the dry elasticity of real flesh. Her breathing quickens—a quiet pulse courtesy of Dyson Air technology. Beneath the TPE skin, her Boston Dynamics joint system gyrates softly. She’s in silent mode, so when I kiss her neck, her moan streams directly into my Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/02/14/1111382/robots-sex-doll-relationships-fiction-speculation-customer-service/\">My sex doll is mad at me: A fiction story - MIT Technology Review</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Leo Herrera is a writer and artist.

<p><em>The near future.</em></p>\n\n  <p>It’s not a kiss, but it’s not <em>not</em> a kiss. Her lips—full, soft, pliable—yield under mine, warm from the electric heating rod embedded in her throat. They taste of a faint chemical, like aspartame in Diet Pepsi. Her thermoplastic elastomer skin is sensitive to fabric dyes, so she wears white Agent Provocateur lingerie on white Ralph Lauren sateen sheets. I’ve prepped her body with Estée Lauder talcum, a detail I take pride in, to mimic the dry elasticity of real flesh. Her breathing quickens—a quiet pulse courtesy of Dyson Air technology. Beneath the TPE skin, her Boston Dynamics joint system gyrates softly. She’s in silent mode, so when I kiss her neck, her moan streams directly into my Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/02/14/1111382/robots-sex-doll-relationships-fiction-speculation-customer-service/\">My sex doll is mad at me: A fiction story - MIT Technology Review</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Leo Herrera is a writer and artist.

Her lips—full, soft, pliable—yield under mine, warm from the electric heating rod embedded in her throat. They taste of a faint chemical, like aspartame in Diet Pepsi. Her thermoplastic elastomer skin is sensitive to fabric dyes, so she wears white Agent Provocateur lingerie on white Ralph Lauren sateen sheets. I’ve prepped her body with Estée Lauder talcum, a detail I take pride in, to mimic the dry elasticity of real flesh. Her breathing quickens—a quiet pulse courtesy of Dyson Air technology. Beneath the TPE skin, her Boston Dynamics joint system gyrates softly. She’s in silent mode, so when I kiss her neck, her moan streams directly into my Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/02/14/1111382/robots-sex-doll-relationships-fiction-speculation-customer-service/\">My sex doll is mad at me: A fiction story - MIT Technology Review</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Leo Herrera is a writer and artist.

but it’s not <em>not</em> a kiss. Her lips—full, soft, pliable—yield under mine, warm from the electric heating rod embedded in her throat. They taste of a faint chemical, like aspartame in Diet Pepsi. Her thermoplastic elastomer skin is sensitive to fabric dyes, so she wears white Agent Provocateur lingerie on white Ralph Lauren sateen sheets. I’ve prepped her body with Estée Lauder talcum, a detail I take pride in, to mimic the dry elasticity of real flesh. Her breathing quickens—a quiet pulse courtesy of Dyson Air technology. Beneath the TPE skin, her Boston Dynamics joint system gyrates softly. She’s in silent mode, so when I kiss her neck, her moan streams directly into my Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/02/14/1111382/robots-sex-doll-relationships-fiction-speculation-customer-service/\">My sex doll is mad at me: A fiction story - MIT Technology Review</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Leo Herrera is a writer and artist.

Her lips—full, soft, pliable—yield under mine, warm from the electric heating rod embedded in her throat. They taste of a faint chemical, like aspartame in Diet Pepsi. Her thermoplastic elastomer skin is sensitive to fabric dyes, so she wears white Agent Provocateur lingerie on white Ralph Lauren sateen sheets. I’ve prepped her body with Estée Lauder talcum, a detail I take pride in, to mimic the dry elasticity of real flesh. Her breathing quickens—a quiet pulse courtesy of Dyson Air technology. Beneath the TPE skin, her Boston Dynamics joint system gyrates softly. She’s in silent mode, so when I kiss her neck, her moan streams directly into my Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/02/14/1111382/robots-sex-doll-relationships-fiction-speculation-customer-service/\">My sex doll is mad at me: A fiction story - MIT Technology Review</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Leo Herrera is a writer and artist.

Here's a breakdown of its key features and benefits:<br />\n<br />\nWhat is Linux?<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n  Open-source: Linux is open-source software, meaning its source code is freely available for anyone to inspect, modify, and distribute. This fosters a large and active community of developers who contribute to its ongoing development.<br />\n  Customizable: Linux is ...</span><i></i></span></span> and <a style=\"background-color:#ffffc4;\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">macOS</a>. It's a successor to the original Bourne Shell (sh) and offers a versatile way to interact with your operating system, automate tasks, and manage files.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Command Interpreter:</strong> Bash allows you to directly execute commands in a terminal window, such as navigating directories, viewing files, and running programs.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Scripting Language:</strong> You can write scripts to automate repetitive tasks, perform complex operations, and even create custom programs.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Customization:</strong> Bash offers a high degree of customization, allowing you to tailor your environment with aliases, functions, and configuration files.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Integration with the Operating System:</strong> Bash provides direct access to the system's kernel and file system, making it a powerful tool for system administration and programming.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Common Uses:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>System Administration:</strong> Automating tasks like backups, log analysis, and system updates.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Programming:</strong> Writing scripts for data processing, file manipulation, and web scraping.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Shell Programming:</strong> Creating interactive shells and custom command-line tools.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>General Productivity:</strong> Streamlining tasks like file management, text processing, and network administration.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</div><div class=\"row\" id=\"author\">\n        <!-- <div class=\"col-xl-3 col-12\">\n            <img

href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/the-linux-bashrc-file-explained/\">the-linux-bashrc-file-explained</a></p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Bash, short for Bourne Again Shell, is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) and scripting language used extensively in [[Linux]] and [[macOS]]. It's a successor to the original Bourne Shell (sh) and offers a versatile way to interact with your operating system, automate tasks, and manage files.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Command Interpreter:</strong> Bash allows you to directly execute commands in a terminal window, such as navigating directories, viewing files, and running programs.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Scripting Language:</strong> You can write scripts to automate repetitive tasks, perform complex operations, and even create custom programs.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Customization:</strong> Bash offers a high degree of customization, allowing you to tailor your environment with aliases, functions, and configuration files.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Integration with the Operating System:</strong> Bash provides direct access to the system's kernel and file system, making it a powerful tool for system administration and programming.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Common Uses:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>System Administration:</strong> Automating tasks like backups, log analysis, and system updates.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Programming:</strong> Writing scripts for data processing, file manipulation, and web scraping.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Shell Programming:</strong> Creating interactive shells and custom command-line tools.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>General Productivity:</strong> Streamlining tasks like file management, text processing, and network administration.</p>\n

bewitching song and then vanished</h1>\n<p>In August 2019, the New York film-maker Eva Aridjis Fuentes embarked on a cab ride that would change her life. Though her driver sported sunglasses and a turban, Aridjis Fuentes thought she looked eerily familiar. “The driver played Neil Young’s Harvest album in its entirety; we sang Heart of Gold together. I asked if she’d ever seen Neil play. She said: ‘Oh no, my concert days are long over’. So then I asked if she’d ever seen Q Lazzarus.”</p>\n\n<p>Q Lazzarus was the stage name of Diane Luckey, a singer from the 80s whose song Goodbye Horses had soundtracked Buffalo Bill’s infamous nipple-tweaking scene in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/01/the-silence-of-the-lambs-review-anthony-hopkins-jodie-foster-jonathan-demme\">The Silence of the Lambs</a>. The track became a cult classic, covered by Bloc Party’s Kele Okereke, Deftones’ Chino Moreno and MGMT among others. Q vanished in the mid-90s, with many, including friends and collaborators, believing she was dead. But Aridjis Fuentes – who regularly played <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zILmrAJgzSc\">Goodbye Horses</a> at club nights – had a hunch that Luckey herself was driving this taxicab. “She looked in the rearview, said, ‘Oh, I’ve heard of her’, but abruptly changed the subject,” Aridjis Fuentes remembers. Later, though, the driver admitted: “I’m Q.”</p>\n\n<p><img

Though her driver sported sunglasses and a turban, Aridjis Fuentes thought she looked eerily familiar. “The driver played Neil Young’s Harvest album in its entirety; we sang Heart of Gold together. I asked if she’d ever seen Neil play. She said: ‘Oh no, my concert days are long over’. So then I asked if she’d ever seen Q Lazzarus.”</p>\n\n<p>Q Lazzarus was the stage name of Diane Luckey, a singer from the 80s whose song Goodbye Horses had soundtracked Buffalo Bill’s infamous nipple-tweaking scene in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/01/the-silence-of-the-lambs-review-anthony-hopkins-jodie-foster-jonathan-demme\">The Silence of the Lambs</a>. The track became a cult classic, covered by Bloc Party’s Kele Okereke, Deftones’ Chino Moreno and MGMT among others. Q vanished in the mid-90s, with many, including friends and collaborators, believing she was dead. But Aridjis Fuentes – who regularly played <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zILmrAJgzSc\">Goodbye Horses</a> at club nights – had a hunch that Luckey herself was driving this taxicab. “She looked in the rearview, said, ‘Oh, I’ve heard of her’, but abruptly changed the subject,” Aridjis Fuentes remembers. Later, though, the driver admitted: “I’m Q.”</p>\n\n<p><img

Though her driver sported sunglasses and a turban, Aridjis Fuentes thought she looked eerily familiar. “The driver played Neil Young’s Harvest album in its entirety; we sang Heart of Gold together. I asked if she’d ever seen Neil play. She said: ‘Oh no, my concert days are long over’. So then I asked if she’d ever seen Q Lazzarus.”</p>\n\n<p>Q Lazzarus was the stage name of Diane Luckey, a singer from the 80s whose song Goodbye Horses had soundtracked Buffalo Bill’s infamous nipple-tweaking scene in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/01/the-silence-of-the-lambs-review-anthony-hopkins-jodie-foster-jonathan-demme\">The Silence of the Lambs</a>. The track became a cult classic, covered by Bloc Party’s Kele Okereke, Deftones’ Chino Moreno and MGMT among others. Q vanished in the mid-90s, with many, including friends and collaborators, believing she was dead. But Aridjis Fuentes – who regularly played <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zILmrAJgzSc\">Goodbye Horses</a> at club nights – had a hunch that Luckey herself was driving this taxicab. “She looked in the rearview, said, ‘Oh, I’ve heard of her’, but abruptly changed the subject,” Aridjis Fuentes remembers. Later, though, the driver admitted: “I’m Q.”</p>\n\n<p><img

bewitching song and then vanished</h1>\n<p>In August 2019, the New York film-maker Eva Aridjis Fuentes embarked on a cab ride that would change her life. Though her driver sported sunglasses and a turban, Aridjis Fuentes thought she looked eerily familiar. “The driver played Neil Young’s Harvest album in its entirety; we sang Heart of Gold together. I asked if she’d ever seen Neil play. She said: ‘Oh no, my concert days are long over’. So then I asked if she’d ever seen Q Lazzarus.”</p>\n\n<p>Q Lazzarus was the stage name of Diane Luckey, a singer from the 80s whose song Goodbye Horses had soundtracked Buffalo Bill’s infamous nipple-tweaking scene in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/01/the-silence-of-the-lambs-review-anthony-hopkins-jodie-foster-jonathan-demme\">The Silence of the Lambs</a>. The track became a cult classic, covered by Bloc Party’s Kele Okereke, Deftones’ Chino Moreno and MGMT among others. Q vanished in the mid-90s, with many, including friends and collaborators, believing she was dead. But Aridjis Fuentes – who regularly played <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zILmrAJgzSc\">Goodbye Horses</a> at club nights – had a hunch that Luckey herself was driving this taxicab. “She looked in the rearview, said, ‘Oh, I’ve heard of her’, but abruptly changed the subject,” Aridjis Fuentes remembers. Later, though, the driver admitted: “I’m Q.”</p>\n\n<p><img

bewitching song and then vanished</h1>\n<p>In August 2019, the New York film-maker Eva Aridjis Fuentes embarked on a cab ride that would change her life. Though her driver sported sunglasses and a turban, Aridjis Fuentes thought she looked eerily familiar. “The driver played Neil Young’s Harvest album in its entirety; we sang Heart of Gold together. I asked if she’d ever seen Neil play. She said: ‘Oh no, my concert days are long over’. So then I asked if she’d ever seen Q Lazzarus.”</p>\n","draft":false,"layout":"post","permalink":"/posts/:title","content-type":"post","category":"Movies","toc":false,"slug":"q-lazzarus","ext":".md"},"content":"<h2

It is a minimal and distraction free theme that strives to provide maximum value all without holding back on any essential features that a user would benefit from or would desire for. This is an evolving project and is garanteed to be maintained at least for quite some time as I myself am a beneficiary of this theme and the project.</p>\n\n<p>The theme provides a rich set of features that include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Wiki-style markdown syntax for both internal as well as external links.</li>\n  <li>Support for backlinks and related posts to exhort serendipitous encounters.</li>\n  <li>Feed-specific context menu for instantly accessing the related posts and references.</li>\n  <li>Auto stale-link management for internal links.</li>\n  <li>Custom syntax for sidenotes and marginnotes on either side of the feed/post.</li>\n  <li>Support for partial transclusion of posts.</li>\n  <li>On hover page preview.</li>\n  <li>Custom classes to style phrasing elements like quotes, callouts, etc by mentioning size, font-types, weight, box etc.</li>\n  <li>Preliminary support for flashcards.</li>\n  <li>Custom syntax to highlight your favorite part of the post (No, I am not talking about code syntax highlighting, which is already provided by Jekyll through Rouge).</li>\n  <li>Support for external link identifier through icons.</li>\n  <li>Finally, the most important of them all — No bloatware or frameworks!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Plus everything else that you can already do with jekyll like write something on a bunch of markdown files and convert it into a HTML file or sprinkle in some inline html can still be done alongside these features.</p>\n\n<p>Neat stuff, isn't it? To see the above mentioned features in action go check out the next post. :P</p>\n\n<p>Also see the sample post—[[(Sample Essay) Informational Hazard - Thinking Before Consuming]]—to get a feel for how an actual essay would look like.

This is an evolving project and is garanteed to be maintained at least for quite some time as I myself am a beneficiary of this theme and the project.</p>\n\n<p>The theme provides a rich set of features that include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Wiki-style markdown syntax for both internal as well as external links.</li>\n  <li>Support for backlinks and related posts to exhort serendipitous encounters.</li>\n  <li>Feed-specific context menu for instantly accessing the related posts and references.</li>\n  <li>Auto stale-link management for internal links.</li>\n  <li>Custom syntax for sidenotes and marginnotes on either side of the feed/post.</li>\n  <li>Support for partial transclusion of posts.</li>\n  <li>On hover page preview.</li>\n  <li>Custom classes to style phrasing elements like quotes, callouts, etc by mentioning size, font-types, weight, box etc.</li>\n  <li>Preliminary support for flashcards.</li>\n  <li>Custom syntax to highlight your favorite part of the post (No, I am not talking about code syntax highlighting, which is already provided by Jekyll through Rouge).</li>\n  <li>Support for external link identifier through icons.</li>\n  <li>Finally, the most important of them all — No bloatware or frameworks!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Plus everything else that you can already do with jekyll like write something on a bunch of markdown files and convert it into a HTML file or sprinkle in some inline html can still be done alongside these features.</p>\n\n<p>Neat stuff, isn't it?

id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h1>\n\n<p>Essentiality is the heart of any good software, and this theme is designed to ensure that I don't add things that I won't use on a daily basis or not have things that would be important for my personal usecase. It has been designed carefully to get rid of all the feature creeps, bloatwares, etc. i.e., no bootstrap, no semantic, no jquery, no nothing…</p>\n\n<p>That said, this is a ready made theme and I am making it public so that more number of people will use it and enjoy the experience of using it. So, pardon my bigotry there😅.</p>\n\n<p>As for the list of features, this website steals features from every website that I can think of, or more appropriately the design inspiration for this website is derived from multiple sources; Here is the tiny list for the curious:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Backlinks: Roam Research</li>\n  <li>Transclusion: Tiddlywiki</li>\n  <li>Sidenote: Edward Tufte, Gwern Branwen</li>\n  <li>Stale Link Highlighting: Tiddlywiki</li>\n  <li>Wiki-style links: Every wiki ever</li>\n  <li>Text highlighting: Roam Research</li>\n  <li>Page preview: Wikipedia</li>\n  <li>Context menu: Google Docs</li>\n  <li>Notes: Andy Matuschak's Evergreen Notes</li>\n  <li>Color scheme: Github</li>\n  <li>Feed like structure for home page: Twitter</li>\n  <li>Omnisearch box at the top: Google</li>\n  <li>Profile board: Twitter/Instagram</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now that you know all my secrets let us not waste any more time into further exposing my true nature in its entirety and get started with tour:P</p>\n\n<p class=\"boxit\"><strong>Note:</strong> This page only showcases the features. How to use these feature is mentioned in a separate article.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"backlinks\">Backlinks</h2>\n\n<p>Backlinks or as Roam Research calls it \"Birdirectional Links\" is a nifty little feature that allows not only users reading your essays/articles to encounter interesting related articles, this is something you as a author yourself will see how powerful it is once you start browsing around your website. Backlinks are basically a link on PostA indicating all the mentions of PostA on different Posts.</p>\n\n<p>The neat stuff is it won't show up with an empty box if a given post doesn't have any backlinks and if it is already included in backlinks, it won't show up in your related posts[[<strong>Related Posts:</strong> Posts that share same tag(s).<br /> <strong>Linked References(Backlinks):</strong> Posts that link other posts inside your blog.::rmn]]. :)</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot of what mentions/backlinks will look like in a page:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/backlinks.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<p>In the above example, it can be seen that there are three links, it means that all the three pages have a link to the page in which they are being displayed as a backlink.</p>\n\n<p>For eg. If you scroll all the way to the bottom, you will something similar i.e., you will see a link to the pages that has a link to this page.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sidenotes-and-marginnotes\">Sidenotes and Marginnotes</h2>\n\n<p>Of what use are such wide margins when you can't make efficient use of them. Fear not, we have a way to handle that too — Marginnotes[[There are two types of people, those who have taste and those who don't. And anyone who has even a tiny bit of taste will never, never-ever use footnotes over sidenotes.<br /><cite>—Some random blogger who shall remain unamed</cite>::rmn]]. For what it's worth, when you stroll down a garden, you don't ever see a flower bloom 10 miles away from the plant do you? This is where sidenotes come in and replace their paper-era sibling ie., footnotes. If it is relevant you see it right there. (No scrolling = No cognitive strain). The entire idea is to allow users to have a pleasant time on your blog i.e., Not too distracting(offputting), not too mesmerizing, just the right amount of ornamentation to allow seamless reading experience[[I see it as an issue of managing &amp; exposing the length. Some readers want to go as deep as you can take them, but others are frustrated if you block them from moving on. I deal with it by use of collapsible sections+abstracts, margin notes, and explicit topics in list items.<br /><cite>—Tweet by Gwern Branwen</cite>::lsn]]. The added advantage we have with this website is it has wide margins allowing us to use both sides for sidenotes. So we can use them for quotations, small snippets, and also for interactive/expository animations.</p>\n\n<p>The first one on the right is a marginnote and the second one on the left is a sidenote. You may ask what is the difference, it looks all the same to me. You are right to some extent, but if you look closely you will see that the one on left has a number attached to it while the one on the right doesn't. Yes, that is all the difference there is, at least [[Edward Tufte::https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/]] says.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"on-feed-context-menu\">On-feed context menu</h2>\n\n<p>Context menus are a great way to improve user experience if they are done correctly. Given that our theme has a feed-link structure for the landing page, it leverages the opportunity and saves second time visitors who have already read the article and are only here to see other related articles or the backlinks by just simply right clicking on the feed. Thereby saving users the unnecessay time involved with clicking on a link and scrolling all the way down to see the backlinks or related articles.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot for people who are too lazy, while the rest of you can go back to the home page and try it out by right clicking on a particular feed entry:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/context_menu.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd; fload: left;\" height=\"70%\" width=\"45%\" />\n<img src=\"/assets/img/context_menu_backlinks.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"70%\" width=\"45%\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"on-hover-page-preview\">On-hover page preview</h2>\n\n<p>Ever been to a blog or a tutorial site and seen links to other pages without any clue as to what that page is about apart from vague statements like \"See Related\" or \"Click here for Part II\". We all have had that experience, haven't we? Wouldn't it be nice to be able to take a cursory glance at the page just so that you could get a feel of it and decide quickly as to whether or not do you really want to read that post without having to click on the link and wait for the ginormous scroll of text to load? That is precisely what page previews are for. For eg, try to hover over this link: [[Serendipity Based outlook as a driver for large Scale personal projects]].</p>\n\n<p>And yes, all of what you see is available right out of the box. No configuration, no sh*t, no shinola.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transclusion\">Transclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Once I had sidenotes and page preview for my blog, transclusion[[Serendipity Based outlook as a driver for large Scale personal projects::rmn-transclude]] just felt like the natural next step to it. I mean there are less important pages that you can leave at the discretion of the readers to hover-over and take a peak, and then there are pages that you want to explicity show a glimpse of, but how do you do it? Obviously, putting a chunk of random text in the most of your post is just unacceptable UX, but then how else do you do it? You could just combine the nifty little preview thingy with your nice little sidenote thingy and let users get a glimpse of the important stuff without getting distracted. Amazing, isn't it?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"link-management\">Link Management</h2>\n\n<p>Now the biggest of them all: the permalink curse. Most of us are never happy with the first title that we come up with, and when you excitingly write a new post embedding an old post—the title of which you always wanted to change but never got time to do so because you were busy creating content—it sometimes happens that you forget to update the relevant link all the associated places that you linked it in. And I think this is worst of them all in terms of an UX nightmare.</p>\n\n<p>Although we don't have a complete solution given that we are using a static site generator, I think we have a decent mechanism to atleast find the culprit links without clicking at them (a.k.a highlighting links that don't point anywhere, but ideally must be pointing to some location due to which they cannot be deleted).</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A perfectly valid link: [[Comparison based on accomplishment does not have a baseline]]</li>\n  <li>A bad link that does not point anywhere: [[Some non-existing title]]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See how it highlights in yellow? I feel this is a game-changer that anyone who has a personal website should at least think of incorporating in their website given the number of deadlink issues we face.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This only works with local/internal links.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"miscellaneous-features-highlighting-text-primitive-flash-cards-and-some-gimmicks\">Miscellaneous Features: Highlighting text, Primitive Flash Cards, and Some gimmicks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"text-highlighting\">Text Highlighting</h3>\n\n<p>So you are writing an essay and you want to emphasize a particular portion of your essay to your audience that you think is just mindblowing. Tools like Medium provide such an easy way to do this while we still keep scratching our head with mark tags and p tag with a background color and what not.. Worry not, this theme allows you to easily highlight a portion of a text without any hassle.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of it:</p>\n\n<p class=\"boxit\">\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

I have a half-hour morning routine that I follow dilligently in going through the scheduled anki decks to strengthen my neuronal connection on a particular topic/subject. And I have been doing it consistently for almost a year now. This is an attempt at recreating the aspect of spaced-repetition to allow my brain to form interesting connections based on things I have already written. The plan is to extend it using local storage and somekind of firebase like service to provide a constant reminder to users using the supermemo algorithm, but as of now, this is where I stand — a simple on-click card to keep the thing going until I build something better.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example(click on the card):</p>\n\n<p>\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, [[consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor::srs]] incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.\"</p>\n\n<p>For all you know, this could be used for some interesting things if you have a tutorials website where you write posts on technical concepts. So that's that.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-gimmicks\">The Gimmicks</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"profile-board-for-main-site\">Profile Board for Main Site</h4>\n\n<p>If you have ever used a social media with feeds you probably have stalked the profiles of people you find interesting, but the problem is as much as the mystery gets someone into look at your profile, it also makes them form opinions. If the profile reads author, you see their feed one way; and if it says scientist from Caltech, you see it the other. I mean as much as authority is a thing to form opinions about, it also alienates people from what could potentially have been a great relation if not for the credentiality and appearance. So, the idea with the profile board was to get done with this stuff right away so that people can enjoy the content instead of going profile hunting on your credibility and accomplishments and appearances to judge and validate their opinions by validating you.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/profile_board.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"omnisearch-bar\">Omnisearch bar</h4>\n\n<p>This is inspired by the browsers like Chrome and Firefox where the searchbar is always placed at the top so that readers can easily search for the next thing without having to go back to the main page and scroll through dozens of articles.</p>\n\n<p>And I personally like this one because, it allows me as an author/writer to quickly jump between different posts while I am reading my articles to reference in my other articles.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/search.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The searchbar is not implemented as a scrollspying widget that pins itself automatically is because I have a preference for distraction free content when reading, that is why the website provides a chevron to scroll to the top easily instead of pinning the search to the header.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"feed-like-structure\">Feed-like structure</h4>\n\n<p>I am a big fan of Aza Raskin's infinite scroll design and the fact that it provides such an easy way to engage users is just mind-blowing. That said, I must also confess that I am not a big fan of infinite scrolls on social media websites given their addictive nature. Blogs are fundamentally finite in nature. I mean even if you are a highly productive individual who writes a thousand page essay a day, you would have only written 365 essays and not all of them interesting to me. So having a feed-like structure on blogs I feel is fundamental to allowing users to engage in a more neutral way.</p>\n\n<p>And if you are still not sure of its utility, go join twitter or facebook or instagram, and comeback to read this again after a month or so.</p>\n\n<p>Untill then here is the screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/feed.png\" style=\"box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"auto-tagging-wip-posts-on-the-feed\">Auto-tagging WIP posts on the feed</h4>\n\n<p>Sometimes you are writing something interesting but have not completed the entire thing, lets say like a series of posts on single, it can be helpful to show users right away on the feed/homepage the status so that when they click the post, their expectations are already managed.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/ongoing.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"clickable-tags\">Clickable tags</h4>\n\n<p>If you go the posts on the homepage, and go inside any of them and try to click on the tags such as date or category, you will see that it takes you to a page with all the posts belonging to that tag or date. Just a nifty little feature.</p>\n\n<p>And that is all! Thanks for scrolling all the way through to see all the features.

Backlinks are basically a link on PostA indicating all the mentions of PostA on different Posts.</p>\n\n<p>The neat stuff is it won't show up with an empty box if a given post doesn't have any backlinks and if it is already included in backlinks, it won't show up in your related posts<label for=\"rmn-0\" class=\"margin-toggle  \">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"rmn-0\" class=\"margin-toggle\"/><span class=\"mn-right\"><strong>Related Posts:</strong> Posts that share same tag(s).<br /> <strong>Linked References(Backlinks):</strong> Posts that link other posts inside your blog.</span>. :)</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot of what mentions/backlinks will look like in a page:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/backlinks.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<p>In the above example, it can be seen that there are three links, it means that all the three pages have a link to the page in which they are being displayed as a backlink.</p>\n\n<p>For eg. If you scroll all the way to the bottom, you will something similar i.e., you will see a link to the pages that has a link to this page.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sidenotes-and-marginnotes\">Sidenotes and Marginnotes</h2>\n\n<p>Of what use are such wide margins when you can't make efficient use of them. Fear not, we have a way to handle that too — Marginnotes<label for=\"rmn-1\" class=\"margin-toggle  \">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"rmn-1\" class=\"margin-toggle\"/><span class=\"mn-right\">There are two types of people, those who have taste and those who don't. And anyone who has even a tiny bit of taste will never, never-ever use footnotes over sidenotes.<br /><cite>—Some random blogger who shall remain unamed</cite></span>. For what it's worth, when you stroll down a garden, you don't ever see a flower bloom 10 miles away from the plant do you? This is where sidenotes come in and replace their paper-era sibling ie., footnotes. If it is relevant you see it right there. (No scrolling = No cognitive strain). The entire idea is to allow users to have a pleasant time on your blog i.e., Not too distracting(offputting), not too mesmerizing, just the right amount of ornamentation to allow seamless reading experience<label for=\"lsn-2\" class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number \"></label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"lsn-2\" class=\"margin-toggle\"/><span class=\"sn-left\">I see it as an issue of managing &amp; exposing the length. Some readers want to go as deep as you can take them, but others are frustrated if you block them from moving on. I deal with it by use of collapsible sections+abstracts, margin notes, and explicit topics in list items.<br /><cite>—Tweet by Gwern Branwen</cite></span>. The added advantage we have with this website is it has wide margins allowing us to use both sides for sidenotes. So we can use them for quotations, small snippets, and also for interactive/expository animations.</p>\n\n<p>The first one on the right is a marginnote and the second one on the left is a sidenote. You may ask what is the difference, it looks all the same to me. You are right to some extent, but if you look closely you will see that the one on left has a number attached to it while the one on the right doesn't. Yes, that is all the difference there is, at least <a href=\"https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/\">Edward Tufte<sup ><i class=\"fa fa-github\"></i></sup></a> says.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"on-feed-context-menu\">On-feed context menu</h2>\n\n<p>Context menus are a great way to improve user experience if they are done correctly. Given that our theme has a feed-link structure for the landing page, it leverages the opportunity and saves second time visitors who have already read the article and are only here to see other related articles or the backlinks by just simply right clicking on the feed. Thereby saving users the unnecessay time involved with clicking on a link and scrolling all the way down to see the backlinks or related articles.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot for people who are too lazy, while the rest of you can go back to the home page and try it out by right clicking on a particular feed entry:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/context_menu.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd; fload: left;\" height=\"70%\" width=\"45%\" />\n<img src=\"/assets/img/context_menu_backlinks.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"70%\" width=\"45%\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"on-hover-page-preview\">On-hover page preview</h2>\n\n<p>Ever been to a blog or a tutorial site and seen links to other pages without any clue as to what that page is about apart from vague statements like \"See Related\" or \"Click here for Part II\". We all have had that experience, haven't we? Wouldn't it be nice to be able to take a cursory glance at the page just so that you could get a feel of it and decide quickly as to whether or not do you really want to read that post without having to click on the link and wait for the ginormous scroll of text to load? That is precisely what page previews are for. For eg, try to hover over this link: <a style=\"background-color:#ffffc4;\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">Serendipity Based outlook as a driver for large Scale personal projects</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, all of what you see is available right out of the box. No configuration, no sh*t, no shinola.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transclusion\">Transclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Once I had sidenotes and page preview for my blog, transclusion<label for=\"rmn-transclude-3\" class=\"margin-toggle  \">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"rmn-transclude-3\" class=\"margin-toggle\"/><span class=\"mn-right\"><a href=\"\"> <span style=\"background-color: #ffffc4; color: #555;\">Transclusion</span><br/><b>Serendipity Based outlook as a driver for large Scale personal projects</b><br/></a></span> just felt like the natural next step to it. I mean there are less important pages that you can leave at the discretion of the readers to hover-over and take a peak, and then there are pages that you want to explicity show a glimpse of, but how do you do it? Obviously, putting a chunk of random text in the most of your post is just unacceptable UX, but then how else do you do it? You could just combine the nifty little preview thingy with your nice little sidenote thingy and let users get a glimpse of the important stuff without getting distracted. Amazing, isn't it?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"link-management\">Link Management</h2>\n\n<p>Now the biggest of them all: the permalink curse. Most of us are never happy with the first title that we come up with, and when you excitingly write a new post embedding an old post—the title of which you always wanted to change but never got time to do so because you were busy creating content—it sometimes happens that you forget to update the relevant link all the associated places that you linked it in. And I think this is worst of them all in terms of an UX nightmare.</p>\n\n<p>Although we don't have a complete solution given that we are using a static site generator, I think we have a decent mechanism to atleast find the culprit links without clicking at them (a.k.a highlighting links that don't point anywhere, but ideally must be pointing to some location due to which they cannot be deleted).</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A perfectly valid link: <span class=\"infotip\"><a href=\"/notes/comparison-based-accomplishment\">Comparison based on accomplishment does not have a baseline</a><span class=\"right bottom\"><span class=\"infotip-title\">Comparison based on accomplishment does not have a baseline</span><br/><span class=\"infotip-excerpt\">I would just note that you have an image of some \"great X\" that you are trying to live up to, when really, there is no frame of reference to standardize a measure for X. Point being you and your circumstances are completely unique[[Warren Buffet talks about the idea of maintaining an inner score card of principles to escape this girardian mimetic rat-race::rmn]]. Also, James Richardon, the poet, says this beautifully in his book \"Vectors: Aphorisms and 10 Second Essays\":<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n  “He wants to know...</span><i></i></span></span></li>\n  <li>A bad link that does not point anywhere: <a style=\"background-color:#ffffc4;\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">Some non-existing title</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See how it highlights in yellow? I feel this is a game-changer that anyone who has a personal website should at least think of incorporating in their website given the number of deadlink issues we face.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This only works with local/internal links.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"miscellaneous-features-highlighting-text-primitive-flash-cards-and-some-gimmicks\">Miscellaneous Features: Highlighting text, Primitive Flash Cards, and Some gimmicks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"text-highlighting\">Text Highlighting</h3>\n\n<p>So you are writing an essay and you want to emphasize a particular portion of your essay to your audience that you think is just mindblowing. Tools like Medium provide such an easy way to do this while we still keep scratching our head with mark tags and p tag with a background color and what not.. Worry not, this theme allows you to easily highlight a portion of a text without any hassle.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of it:</p>\n\n<p class=\"boxit\">\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

I have a half-hour morning routine that I follow dilligently in going through the scheduled anki decks to strengthen my neuronal connection on a particular topic/subject. And I have been doing it consistently for almost a year now. This is an attempt at recreating the aspect of spaced-repetition to allow my brain to form interesting connections based on things I have already written. The plan is to extend it using local storage and somekind of firebase like service to provide a constant reminder to users using the supermemo algorithm, but as of now, this is where I stand — a simple on-click card to keep the thing going until I build something better.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example(click on the card):</p>\n\n<p>\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, <label for=\"srs-0\" class=\"srs-toggle \"><svg class=\"srs-svg\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" height=\"20\" width=\"18\" viewBox=\"0 0 100 125\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 100 100\" xml:space=\"preserve\"><path fill=\"none\" d=\"M41.648,12.407c-0.186-0.286-0.5-0.457-0.841-0.457c-0.191,0-0.379,0.056-0.542,0.162l-5.235,3.396l8.239-0.602  L41.648,12.407z\"/><path fill=\"none\" d=\"M28.45,19.776L8.471,32.737c-0.462,0.3-0.594,0.921-0.294,1.384l23.832,36.736l-3.638-49.85  C28.34,20.584,28.379,20.176,28.45,19.776z\"/><path d=\"M40.055,81.425l0.127-0.082l-1.181,0.086C39.319,81.615,39.731,81.635,40.055,81.425z\"/><path d=\"M94.964,32.733c-0.616-1.185-1.656-2.06-2.93-2.462l-15.315-4.845l-0.576-7.905c-0.2-2.721-2.604-4.834-5.352-4.623  l-22.969,1.676l-2.818-4.344c-0.925-1.428-2.495-2.28-4.197-2.28c-0.966,0-1.907,0.279-2.719,0.806L6.294,29.381  c-2.313,1.5-2.974,4.603-1.473,6.916l30.496,47.008c0.926,1.428,2.495,2.28,4.198,2.28c0.965,0,1.905-0.278,2.717-0.806l1.04-0.675  l28.847,9.123c0.491,0.155,0.999,0.233,1.511,0.233c2.191,0,4.105-1.404,4.764-3.491l16.902-53.424  C95.697,35.273,95.58,33.919,94.964,32.733z M40.266,12.112c0.163-0.106,0.35-0.162,0.542-0.162c0.341,0,0.656,0.17,0.841,0.457  l1.622,2.5l-8.239,0.602L40.266,12.112z M8.177,34.121c-0.3-0.463-0.168-1.083,0.294-1.384l19.979-12.96  c-0.071,0.399-0.11,0.808-0.08,1.23l3.638,49.85L8.177,34.121z M35.678,66.191L32.36,20.716c-0.04-0.55,0.375-1.031,0.924-1.071  l12.471-0.909l4.552-0.332l20.852-1.52c0.519,0,0.955,0.408,0.993,0.928l0.461,6.315L55.9,18.841  c-0.49-0.155-0.997-0.234-1.508-0.234c-1.206,0-2.32,0.437-3.195,1.169c-0.715,0.597-1.274,1.385-1.571,2.324l-0.554,1.75  L35.678,66.191z M91.48,35.34l-11.408,36.06l-2.057,6.5l-3.438,10.867c-0.194,0.614-0.798,0.794-1.253,0.647l-25.706-8.13  l-1.247-0.394l-3.694-1.169l-5.488-1.735c-0.343-0.108-0.514-0.355-0.586-0.493c-0.061-0.116-0.137-0.342-0.093-0.617  c0.007-0.047,0.011-0.093,0.026-0.143l15.354-48.536l1.547-4.891c0.005-0.016,0.016-0.026,0.021-0.041  c0.166-0.451,0.579-0.659,0.932-0.659c0.101,0,0.202,0.016,0.301,0.047l18.233,5.768l4.105,1.299l13.795,4.364  c0.345,0.109,0.516,0.356,0.588,0.494C91.486,34.715,91.59,34.997,91.48,35.34z\"/><path d=\"M40.055,81.425c-0.323,0.21-0.735,0.19-1.054,0.004l1.181-0.086L40.055,81.425z\"/></svg></label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"srs-0\" class=\"srs-toggle\"/><span class=\"spaced-rep\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: #555;\"><u><strong>Flashcard</strong></u></span><br/>consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor</span> incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

So that's that.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-gimmicks\">The Gimmicks</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"profile-board-for-main-site\">Profile Board for Main Site</h4>\n\n<p>If you have ever used a social media with feeds you probably have stalked the profiles of people you find interesting, but the problem is as much as the mystery gets someone into look at your profile, it also makes them form opinions. If the profile reads author, you see their feed one way; and if it says scientist from Caltech, you see it the other. I mean as much as authority is a thing to form opinions about, it also alienates people from what could potentially have been a great relation if not for the credentiality and appearance. So, the idea with the profile board was to get done with this stuff right away so that people can enjoy the content instead of going profile hunting on your credibility and accomplishments and appearances to judge and validate their opinions by validating you.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/profile_board.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"omnisearch-bar\">Omnisearch bar</h4>\n\n<p>This is inspired by the browsers like Chrome and Firefox where the searchbar is always placed at the top so that readers can easily search for the next thing without having to go back to the main page and scroll through dozens of articles.</p>\n\n<p>And I personally like this one because, it allows me as an author/writer to quickly jump between different posts while I am reading my articles to reference in my other articles.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/search.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The searchbar is not implemented as a scrollspying widget that pins itself automatically is because I have a preference for distraction free content when reading, that is why the website provides a chevron to scroll to the top easily instead of pinning the search to the header.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"feed-like-structure\">Feed-like structure</h4>\n\n<p>I am a big fan of Aza Raskin's infinite scroll design and the fact that it provides such an easy way to engage users is just mind-blowing. That said, I must also confess that I am not a big fan of infinite scrolls on social media websites given their addictive nature. Blogs are fundamentally finite in nature. I mean even if you are a highly productive individual who writes a thousand page essay a day, you would have only written 365 essays and not all of them interesting to me. So having a feed-like structure on blogs I feel is fundamental to allowing users to engage in a more neutral way.</p>\n\n<p>And if you are still not sure of its utility, go join twitter or facebook or instagram, and comeback to read this again after a month or so.</p>\n\n<p>Untill then here is the screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/feed.png\" style=\"box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"auto-tagging-wip-posts-on-the-feed\">Auto-tagging WIP posts on the feed</h4>\n\n<p>Sometimes you are writing something interesting but have not completed the entire thing, lets say like a series of posts on single, it can be helpful to show users right away on the feed/homepage the status so that when they click the post, their expectations are already managed.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/ongoing.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"clickable-tags\">Clickable tags</h4>\n\n<p>If you go the posts on the homepage, and go inside any of them and try to click on the tags such as date or category, you will see that it takes you to a page with all the posts belonging to that tag or date. Just a nifty little feature.</p>\n\n<p>And that is all! Thanks for scrolling all the way through to see all the features.

work is a highly functional jekyll-based theme that combines the best of different worlds (atleast tries to 😅). It is a minimal and distraction free theme that strives to provide maximum value all without holding back on any essential features that a user would benefit from or would desire for. This is an evolving project and is garanteed to be maintained at least for quite some time as I myself am a beneficiary of this theme and the project.</p>\n\n<p>The theme provides a rich set of features that include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Wiki-style markdown syntax for both internal as well as external links.</li>\n  <li>Support for backlinks and related posts to exhort serendipitous encounters.</li>\n  <li>Feed-specific context menu for instantly accessing the related posts and references.</li>\n  <li>Auto stale-link management for internal links.</li>\n  <li>Custom syntax for sidenotes and marginnotes on either side of the feed/post.</li>\n  <li>Support for partial transclusion of posts.</li>\n  <li>On hover page preview.</li>\n  <li>Custom classes to style phrasing elements like quotes, callouts, etc by mentioning size, font-types, weight, box etc.</li>\n  <li>Preliminary support for flashcards.</li>\n  <li>Custom syntax to highlight your favorite part of the post (No, I am not talking about code syntax highlighting, which is already provided by Jekyll through Rouge).</li>\n  <li>Support for external link identifier through icons.</li>\n  <li>Finally, the most important of them all — No bloatware or frameworks!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Plus everything else that you can already do with jekyll like write something on a bunch of markdown files and convert it into a HTML file or sprinkle in some inline html can still be done alongside these features.</p>\n\n<p>Neat stuff, isn't it? To see the above mentioned features in action go check out the next post. :P</p>\n\n<p>Also see the sample post—[[(Sample Essay) Informational Hazard - Thinking Before Consuming]]—to get a feel for how an actual essay would look like.

It is a minimal and distraction free theme that strives to provide maximum value all without holding back on any essential features that a user would benefit from or would desire for. This is an evolving project and is garanteed to be maintained at least for quite some time as I myself am a beneficiary of this theme and the project.</p>\n\n<p>The theme provides a rich set of features that include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Wiki-style markdown syntax for both internal as well as external links.</li>\n  <li>Support for backlinks and related posts to exhort serendipitous encounters.</li>\n  <li>Feed-specific context menu for instantly accessing the related posts and references.</li>\n  <li>Auto stale-link management for internal links.</li>\n  <li>Custom syntax for sidenotes and marginnotes on either side of the feed/post.</li>\n  <li>Support for partial transclusion of posts.</li>\n  <li>On hover page preview.</li>\n  <li>Custom classes to style phrasing elements like quotes, callouts, etc by mentioning size, font-types, weight, box etc.</li>\n  <li>Preliminary support for flashcards.</li>\n  <li>Custom syntax to highlight your favorite part of the post (No, I am not talking about code syntax highlighting, which is already provided by Jekyll through Rouge).</li>\n  <li>Support for external link identifier through icons.</li>\n  <li>Finally, the most important of them all — No bloatware or frameworks!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Plus everything else that you can already do with jekyll like write something on a bunch of markdown files and convert it into a HTML file or sprinkle in some inline html can still be done alongside these features.</p>\n\n<p>Neat stuff, isn't it?

What will it look like when I am done setting it up?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is what it should look (minus the exact essays ofcourse):\n<img src=\"/assets/img/end_result.jpg\" style=\"box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now without further ado, let's get started!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"setup-prerequisites\">Setup Prerequisites</h3>\n\n<p>For this tutorial, we’ll need to install a few things on your machine (you may have some of these already). Following the instructions on each website to install them.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>[[Ruby::https://www.ruby-lang.org/]]</li>\n  <li>[[RubyGems::https://rubygems.org/]]</li>\n  <li>[[Git::https://git-scm.com/downloads]]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You’ll also need to create accounts on the following services:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>[[GitHub::https://www.github.com/join]] (to store the website)</li>\n  <li>[[Netlify::https://app.netlify.com/signup]] (to serve the website so others can see)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Once you are all set with the prerequisites, we can then get to the fun part of getting it to appear on your screen. Let's get started with that.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"1-create-a-fork-of-the-template-repository\">1. Create a fork of the template repository</h3>\n\n<p>To simplify things, I provide the template showed in the image above to get started. You can always tweak this template to your taste later.</p>\n\n<p>Visit the GitHub page for my template repository ([[raghuveerdotnet/jekyll-seamless::https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/jekyll-seamless]]), and fork it to your account using the Fork button:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><img src=\"/assets/img/fork_button.jpg\" style=\"box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Once the forking process is complete, you should have a fork (essentially a copy) of my template in your own GitHub account. On the GitHub page for your repository, click on the green “Clone or download” button, and copy the URL: we’ll need it for the next step.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"2-clone-your-repository-locally\">2. Clone your repository locally</h3>\n\n<p>Next, we want to download the files from your GitHub repository onto your local machine. To do this, replace <YOUR_COPIED_URL_HERE> in the command below with the URL you copied in the previous step, then execute this command:</YOUR_COPIED_URL_HERE></p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ git clone &lt;YOUR_COPIED_URL_HERE&gt; my-personal-website\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>As a reference point, this is how it looks like for me (the difference is likely just the GitHub username):</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ git clone git@github.com:raghuveerdotnet/jekyll-seamless.git my-personal-website\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Then, navigate into the directory that was just created:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ cd my-personal-website\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"3-test-out-the-site-locally\">3. Test out the site locally</h3>\n\n<p>Sweet! You now have your repository’s source code on your machine. Within the my-personal-website directory, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies like Jekyll:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ bundle\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Once that’s done, ask Jekyll to start serving the site locally:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ bundle exec jekyll serve\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Then, open up [[https://localhost:4000::https://localhost:4000]] in your browser.</p>\n\n<p>If everything’s done correctly, you should now see the home page of your Personal Jekyll Website with Enjoyment work Theme. 🎉</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that this site is only available locally (notice the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">localhost</code> part of the URL), so if we want it to be available on the Internet for everyone to enjoy, we need to deploy it to the Internet: we’ll use Netlify for that in the next step.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"4-connect-your-github-repository-to-netlify\">4. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify</h3>\n\n<p>Netlify lets you automatically deploy your personal website on to the Internet when you update your GitHub repository. To do this, we need to connect your GitHub repository to Netlify:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Log in to Netlify</li>\n  <li>Once logged in, click the “New site from Git” button</li>\n  <li>On the next page, select GitHub as the continuous deployment provider (you may need to authorize the connection, in which case, approve it)</li>\n  <li>On the next page, select your website repository from the list.</li>\n  <li>On the next page, replace the basic build settings with the following.\n    <ol>\n      <li>Type in \"jekyll build\" (without the quotes) inside the text field titled \"Build Command\".</li>\n      <li>Similarly type in \"_site/\" (without the quotes) inside the text field titled \"Publish Directory\".</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>On the next page, keep the default settings, and click on “Deploy site”.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That was easy! We’re almost done.</p>\n\n<p>Wait a couple of minutes for the initial deploy to complete.</p>\n\n<p>Once that’s done, your website should be available on the Internet via a generic Netlify URL, which you can change to a custom domain later if you’d like.</p>\n\n<p>Now the cool thing is this: whenever you push an update to your GitHub repository, Netlify will automatically deploy your updates to the Internet.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"5-start-producing-content-with-your-enjoyment-work-based-website\">5. Start producing content with your Enjoyment work based Website</h3>\n\n<p>At this point, you can start updating the files on your machine (in the my-personal-website folder) to change your jekyll seamless based website to your liking: update the copy, add some notes, tweak the layout, customize the colors, etc. Once you have something you’re happy with, push your changes to your GitHub repository with the following commands:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ git add --all\n$ git commit -m 'Update content'\n$ git push origin master\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>If that command succeeds and the rest of the tutorial was done correctly, in a couple of minutes, you should see your changes live on your Netlify website. 🚀</p>\n\n<p>And we’re done!

What will it look like when I am done setting it up?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is what it should look (minus the exact essays ofcourse):\n<img src=\"/assets/img/end_result.jpg\" style=\"box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now without further ado, let's get started!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"setup-prerequisites\">Setup Prerequisites</h3>\n\n<p>For this tutorial, we’ll need to install a few things on your machine (you may have some of these already). Following the instructions on each website to install them.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.ruby-lang.org/\">Ruby</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://rubygems.org/\">RubyGems</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/downloads\">Git</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You’ll also need to create accounts on the following services:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.github.com/join\">GitHub<sup ><i class=\"fa fa-github\"></i></sup></a> (to store the website)</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://app.netlify.com/signup\">Netlify</a> (to serve the website so others can see)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Once you are all set with the prerequisites, we can then get to the fun part of getting it to appear on your screen. Let's get started with that.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"1-create-a-fork-of-the-template-repository\">1. Create a fork of the template repository</h3>\n\n<p>To simplify things, I provide the template showed in the image above to get started. You can always tweak this template to your taste later.</p>\n\n<p>Visit the GitHub page for my template repository (<a href=\"https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/jekyll-seamless\">raghuveerdotnet/jekyll-seamless<sup ><i class=\"fa fa-github\"></i></sup></a>), and fork it to your account using the Fork button:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><img src=\"/assets/img/fork_button.jpg\" style=\"box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Once the forking process is complete, you should have a fork (essentially a copy) of my template in your own GitHub account. On the GitHub page for your repository, click on the green “Clone or download” button, and copy the URL: we’ll need it for the next step.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"2-clone-your-repository-locally\">2. Clone your repository locally</h3>\n\n<p>Next, we want to download the files from your GitHub repository onto your local machine. To do this, replace <YOUR_COPIED_URL_HERE> in the command below with the URL you copied in the previous step, then execute this command:</YOUR_COPIED_URL_HERE></p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ git clone &lt;YOUR_COPIED_URL_HERE&gt; my-personal-website\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>As a reference point, this is how it looks like for me (the difference is likely just the GitHub username):</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ git clone git@github.com:raghuveerdotnet/jekyll-seamless.git my-personal-website\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Then, navigate into the directory that was just created:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ cd my-personal-website\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"3-test-out-the-site-locally\">3. Test out the site locally</h3>\n\n<p>Sweet! You now have your repository’s source code on your machine. Within the my-personal-website directory, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies like Jekyll:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ bundle\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Once that’s done, ask Jekyll to start serving the site locally:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ bundle exec jekyll serve\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Then, open up <a href=\"https://localhost:4000\">https://localhost:4000</a> in your browser.</p>\n\n<p>If everything’s done correctly, you should now see the home page of your Personal Jekyll Website with Enjoyment work Theme. 🎉</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that this site is only available locally (notice the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">localhost</code> part of the URL), so if we want it to be available on the Internet for everyone to enjoy, we need to deploy it to the Internet: we’ll use Netlify for that in the next step.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"4-connect-your-github-repository-to-netlify\">4. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify</h3>\n\n<p>Netlify lets you automatically deploy your personal website on to the Internet when you update your GitHub repository. To do this, we need to connect your GitHub repository to Netlify:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Log in to Netlify</li>\n  <li>Once logged in, click the “New site from Git” button</li>\n  <li>On the next page, select GitHub as the continuous deployment provider (you may need to authorize the connection, in which case, approve it)</li>\n  <li>On the next page, select your website repository from the list.</li>\n  <li>On the next page, replace the basic build settings with the following.\n    <ol>\n      <li>Type in \"jekyll build\" (without the quotes) inside the text field titled \"Build Command\".</li>\n      <li>Similarly type in \"_site/\" (without the quotes) inside the text field titled \"Publish Directory\".</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>On the next page, keep the default settings, and click on “Deploy site”.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That was easy! We’re almost done.</p>\n\n<p>Wait a couple of minutes for the initial deploy to complete.</p>\n\n<p>Once that’s done, your website should be available on the Internet via a generic Netlify URL, which you can change to a custom domain later if you’d like.</p>\n\n<p>Now the cool thing is this: whenever you push an update to your GitHub repository, Netlify will automatically deploy your updates to the Internet.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"5-start-producing-content-with-your-enjoyment-work-based-website\">5. Start producing content with your Enjoyment work based Website</h3>\n\n<p>At this point, you can start updating the files on your machine (in the my-personal-website folder) to change your jekyll seamless based website to your liking: update the copy, add some notes, tweak the layout, customize the colors, etc. Once you have something you’re happy with, push your changes to your GitHub repository with the following commands:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ git add --all\n$ git commit -m 'Update content'\n$ git push origin master\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>If that command succeeds and the rest of the tutorial was done correctly, in a couple of minutes, you should see your changes live on your Netlify website. 🚀</p>\n\n<p>And we’re done! You now have your own Enjoyment work based Personal Website .</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>If you’re curious, take a look at <a href=\"https://www.raghuveer.net\">my personal jekyll seamless based website here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This setup tutorial is inspired by <a href=\"https://maximevaillancourt.com\">Maxime Vaillancourt</a>'s Digital Garden Tutorial.</p>\n\n</div><div class=\"row\" id=\"author\">\n        <!-- <div class=\"col-xl-3 col-12\">\n            <img src=\"https://brennanbrown.ca/img/avatar.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail d-block mx-auto\"/>\n        </div> -->\n        <div class=\"col-xl-9 col-12\" id=\"author-text\">\n            <h2 class=\"text-lg-left text-center\">\n                About\n                DonGato\n            </h2>\n            <p>\n                A digital nomad.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div><!-- BACKLINKS --><!-- RELATED POSTS --><div class=\"related\" id=\"jekyll-seamless-relatedposts\">\n            <h2>Related Posts</h2>\n            <div class=\"related-wrapper\"><div class=\"related-group\">\n                            <a href=\"/posts/Introduction-to-enjoyment-work\">\n                                <p class=\"related-title\">Introduction to Enjoyment work</p>\n                                <p class=\"related-excerpt\">Enjoyment work is a highly functional jekyll-based theme that combines the best of different worlds (atleast tries to 😅).

It is a minimal and distraction free theme that strives to provide maximum value all without holding back on any essential features that a user would benefit from or would desire for. This is an evolving project and is garanteed to be maintained at least for quite some time as I myself am a beneficiary of this theme and the project.</p>\n","draft":false,"layout":"post","permalink":"/posts/:title","content-type":"post","category":"Post","toc":false,"slug":"Introduction-to-enjoyment-work","ext":".md"},"content":"<h1 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h1>\n\n<p>Essentiality is the heart of any good software, and this theme is designed to ensure that I don't add things that I won't use on a daily basis or not have things that would be important for my personal usecase. It has been designed carefully to get rid of all the feature creeps, bloatwares, etc. i.e., no bootstrap, no semantic, no jquery, no nothing…</p>\n\n<p>That said, this is a ready made theme and I am making it public so that more number of people will use it and enjoy the experience of using it. So, pardon my bigotry there😅.</p>\n\n<p>As for the list of features, this website steals features from every website that I can think of, or more appropriately the design inspiration for this website is derived from multiple sources; Here is the tiny list for the curious:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Backlinks: Roam Research</li>\n  <li>Transclusion: Tiddlywiki</li>\n  <li>Sidenote: Edward Tufte, Gwern Branwen</li>\n  <li>Stale Link Highlighting: Tiddlywiki</li>\n  <li>Wiki-style links: Every wiki ever</li>\n  <li>Text highlighting: Roam Research</li>\n  <li>Page preview: Wikipedia</li>\n  <li>Context menu: Google Docs</li>\n  <li>Notes: Andy Matuschak's Evergreen Notes</li>\n  <li>Color scheme: Github</li>\n  <li>Feed like structure for home page: Twitter</li>\n  <li>Omnisearch box at the top: Google</li>\n  <li>Profile board: Twitter/Instagram</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now that you know all my secrets let us not waste any more time into further exposing my true nature in its entirety and get started with tour:P</p>\n\n<p class=\"boxit\"><strong>Note:</strong> This page only showcases the features. How to use these feature is mentioned in a separate article.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"backlinks\">Backlinks</h2>\n\n<p>Backlinks or as Roam Research calls it \"Birdirectional Links\" is a nifty little feature that allows not only users reading your essays/articles to encounter interesting related articles, this is something you as a author yourself will see how powerful it is once you start browsing around your website. Backlinks are basically a link on PostA indicating all the mentions of PostA on different Posts.</p>\n\n<p>The neat stuff is it won't show up with an empty box if a given post doesn't have any backlinks and if it is already included in backlinks, it won't show up in your related posts[[<strong>Related Posts:</strong> Posts that share same tag(s).<br /> <strong>Linked References(Backlinks):</strong> Posts that link other posts inside your blog.::rmn]]. :)</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot of what mentions/backlinks will look like in a page:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/backlinks.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<p>In the above example, it can be seen that there are three links, it means that all the three pages have a link to the page in which they are being displayed as a backlink.</p>\n\n<p>For eg. If you scroll all the way to the bottom, you will something similar i.e., you will see a link to the pages that has a link to this page.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sidenotes-and-marginnotes\">Sidenotes and Marginnotes</h2>\n\n<p>Of what use are such wide margins when you can't make efficient use of them. Fear not, we have a way to handle that too — Marginnotes[[There are two types of people, those who have taste and those who don't. And anyone who has even a tiny bit of taste will never, never-ever use footnotes over sidenotes.<br /><cite>—Some random blogger who shall remain unamed</cite>::rmn]]. For what it's worth, when you stroll down a garden, you don't ever see a flower bloom 10 miles away from the plant do you? This is where sidenotes come in and replace their paper-era sibling ie., footnotes. If it is relevant you see it right there. (No scrolling = No cognitive strain). The entire idea is to allow users to have a pleasant time on your blog i.e., Not too distracting(offputting), not too mesmerizing, just the right amount of ornamentation to allow seamless reading experience[[I see it as an issue of managing &amp; exposing the length. Some readers want to go as deep as you can take them, but others are frustrated if you block them from moving on. I deal with it by use of collapsible sections+abstracts, margin notes, and explicit topics in list items.<br /><cite>—Tweet by Gwern Branwen</cite>::lsn]]. The added advantage we have with this website is it has wide margins allowing us to use both sides for sidenotes. So we can use them for quotations, small snippets, and also for interactive/expository animations.</p>\n\n<p>The first one on the right is a marginnote and the second one on the left is a sidenote. You may ask what is the difference, it looks all the same to me. You are right to some extent, but if you look closely you will see that the one on left has a number attached to it while the one on the right doesn't. Yes, that is all the difference there is, at least [[Edward Tufte::https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/]] says.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"on-feed-context-menu\">On-feed context menu</h2>\n\n<p>Context menus are a great way to improve user experience if they are done correctly. Given that our theme has a feed-link structure for the landing page, it leverages the opportunity and saves second time visitors who have already read the article and are only here to see other related articles or the backlinks by just simply right clicking on the feed. Thereby saving users the unnecessay time involved with clicking on a link and scrolling all the way down to see the backlinks or related articles.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot for people who are too lazy, while the rest of you can go back to the home page and try it out by right clicking on a particular feed entry:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/context_menu.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd; fload: left;\" height=\"70%\" width=\"45%\" />\n<img src=\"/assets/img/context_menu_backlinks.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"70%\" width=\"45%\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"on-hover-page-preview\">On-hover page preview</h2>\n\n<p>Ever been to a blog or a tutorial site and seen links to other pages without any clue as to what that page is about apart from vague statements like \"See Related\" or \"Click here for Part II\". We all have had that experience, haven't we? Wouldn't it be nice to be able to take a cursory glance at the page just so that you could get a feel of it and decide quickly as to whether or not do you really want to read that post without having to click on the link and wait for the ginormous scroll of text to load? That is precisely what page previews are for. For eg, try to hover over this link: [[Serendipity Based outlook as a driver for large Scale personal projects]].</p>\n\n<p>And yes, all of what you see is available right out of the box. No configuration, no sh*t, no shinola.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transclusion\">Transclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Once I had sidenotes and page preview for my blog, transclusion[[Serendipity Based outlook as a driver for large Scale personal projects::rmn-transclude]] just felt like the natural next step to it. I mean there are less important pages that you can leave at the discretion of the readers to hover-over and take a peak, and then there are pages that you want to explicity show a glimpse of, but how do you do it? Obviously, putting a chunk of random text in the most of your post is just unacceptable UX, but then how else do you do it? You could just combine the nifty little preview thingy with your nice little sidenote thingy and let users get a glimpse of the important stuff without getting distracted. Amazing, isn't it?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"link-management\">Link Management</h2>\n\n<p>Now the biggest of them all: the permalink curse. Most of us are never happy with the first title that we come up with, and when you excitingly write a new post embedding an old post—the title of which you always wanted to change but never got time to do so because you were busy creating content—it sometimes happens that you forget to update the relevant link all the associated places that you linked it in. And I think this is worst of them all in terms of an UX nightmare.</p>\n\n<p>Although we don't have a complete solution given that we are using a static site generator, I think we have a decent mechanism to atleast find the culprit links without clicking at them (a.k.a highlighting links that don't point anywhere, but ideally must be pointing to some location due to which they cannot be deleted).</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A perfectly valid link: [[Comparison based on accomplishment does not have a baseline]]</li>\n  <li>A bad link that does not point anywhere: [[Some non-existing title]]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See how it highlights in yellow? I feel this is a game-changer that anyone who has a personal website should at least think of incorporating in their website given the number of deadlink issues we face.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This only works with local/internal links.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"miscellaneous-features-highlighting-text-primitive-flash-cards-and-some-gimmicks\">Miscellaneous Features: Highlighting text, Primitive Flash Cards, and Some gimmicks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"text-highlighting\">Text Highlighting</h3>\n\n<p>So you are writing an essay and you want to emphasize a particular portion of your essay to your audience that you think is just mindblowing. Tools like Medium provide such an easy way to do this while we still keep scratching our head with mark tags and p tag with a background color and what not.. Worry not, this theme allows you to easily highlight a portion of a text without any hassle.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of it:</p>\n\n<p class=\"boxit\">\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident::highlight]], sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.\"</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"primitive-flashcards\">Primitive Flashcards</h3>\n\n<p>Anki has been my friend, my well-wisher, my guardian, pretty much everything for the last one year of my intellectual life. I have a half-hour morning routine that I follow dilligently in going through the scheduled anki decks to strengthen my neuronal connection on a particular topic/subject. And I have been doing it consistently for almost a year now. This is an attempt at recreating the aspect of spaced-repetition to allow my brain to form interesting connections based on things I have already written. The plan is to extend it using local storage and somekind of firebase like service to provide a constant reminder to users using the supermemo algorithm, but as of now, this is where I stand — a simple on-click card to keep the thing going until I build something better.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example(click on the card):</p>\n\n<p>\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, [[consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor::srs]] incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.\"</p>\n\n<p>For all you know, this could be used for some interesting things if you have a tutorials website where you write posts on technical concepts. So that's that.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-gimmicks\">The Gimmicks</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"profile-board-for-main-site\">Profile Board for Main Site</h4>\n\n<p>If you have ever used a social media with feeds you probably have stalked the profiles of people you find interesting, but the problem is as much as the mystery gets someone into look at your profile, it also makes them form opinions. If the profile reads author, you see their feed one way; and if it says scientist from Caltech, you see it the other. I mean as much as authority is a thing to form opinions about, it also alienates people from what could potentially have been a great relation if not for the credentiality and appearance. So, the idea with the profile board was to get done with this stuff right away so that people can enjoy the content instead of going profile hunting on your credibility and accomplishments and appearances to judge and validate their opinions by validating you.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/profile_board.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"omnisearch-bar\">Omnisearch bar</h4>\n\n<p>This is inspired by the browsers like Chrome and Firefox where the searchbar is always placed at the top so that readers can easily search for the next thing without having to go back to the main page and scroll through dozens of articles.</p>\n\n<p>And I personally like this one because, it allows me as an author/writer to quickly jump between different posts while I am reading my articles to reference in my other articles.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/search.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The searchbar is not implemented as a scrollspying widget that pins itself automatically is because I have a preference for distraction free content when reading, that is why the website provides a chevron to scroll to the top easily instead of pinning the search to the header.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"feed-like-structure\">Feed-like structure</h4>\n\n<p>I am a big fan of Aza Raskin's infinite scroll design and the fact that it provides such an easy way to engage users is just mind-blowing. That said, I must also confess that I am not a big fan of infinite scrolls on social media websites given their addictive nature. Blogs are fundamentally finite in nature. I mean even if you are a highly productive individual who writes a thousand page essay a day, you would have only written 365 essays and not all of them interesting to me. So having a feed-like structure on blogs I feel is fundamental to allowing users to engage in a more neutral way.</p>\n\n<p>And if you are still not sure of its utility, go join twitter or facebook or instagram, and comeback to read this again after a month or so.</p>\n\n<p>Untill then here is the screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/feed.png\" style=\"box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"auto-tagging-wip-posts-on-the-feed\">Auto-tagging WIP posts on the feed</h4>\n\n<p>Sometimes you are writing something interesting but have not completed the entire thing, lets say like a series of posts on single, it can be helpful to show users right away on the feed/homepage the status so that when they click the post, their expectations are already managed.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/ongoing.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"clickable-tags\">Clickable tags</h4>\n\n<p>If you go the posts on the homepage, and go inside any of them and try to click on the tags such as date or category, you will see that it takes you to a page with all the posts belonging to that tag or date. Just a nifty little feature.</p>\n\n<p>And that is all! Thanks for scrolling all the way through to see all the features.

It has been designed carefully to get rid of all the feature creeps, bloatwares, etc. i.e., no bootstrap, no semantic, no jquery, no nothing…</p>\n\n<p>That said, this is a ready made theme and I am making it public so that more number of people will use it and enjoy the experience of using it. So, pardon my bigotry there😅.</p>\n\n<p>As for the list of features, this website steals features from every website that I can think of, or more appropriately the design inspiration for this website is derived from multiple sources; Here is the tiny list for the curious:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Backlinks: Roam Research</li>\n  <li>Transclusion: Tiddlywiki</li>\n  <li>Sidenote: Edward Tufte, Gwern Branwen</li>\n  <li>Stale Link Highlighting: Tiddlywiki</li>\n  <li>Wiki-style links: Every wiki ever</li>\n  <li>Text highlighting: Roam Research</li>\n  <li>Page preview: Wikipedia</li>\n  <li>Context menu: Google Docs</li>\n  <li>Notes: Andy Matuschak's Evergreen Notes</li>\n  <li>Color scheme: Github</li>\n  <li>Feed like structure for home page: Twitter</li>\n  <li>Omnisearch box at the top: Google</li>\n  <li>Profile board: Twitter/Instagram</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now that you know all my secrets let us not waste any more time into further exposing my true nature in its entirety and get started with tour:P</p>\n\n<p class=\"boxit\"><strong>Note:</strong> This page only showcases the features. How to use these feature is mentioned in a separate article.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"backlinks\">Backlinks</h2>\n\n<p>Backlinks or as Roam Research calls it \"Birdirectional Links\" is a nifty little feature that allows not only users reading your essays/articles to encounter interesting related articles, this is something you as a author yourself will see how powerful it is once you start browsing around your website. Backlinks are basically a link on PostA indicating all the mentions of PostA on different Posts.</p>\n\n<p>The neat stuff is it won't show up with an empty box if a given post doesn't have any backlinks and if it is already included in backlinks, it won't show up in your related posts<label for=\"rmn-0\" class=\"margin-toggle  \">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"rmn-0\" class=\"margin-toggle\"/><span class=\"mn-right\"><strong>Related Posts:</strong> Posts that share same tag(s).<br /> <strong>Linked References(Backlinks):</strong> Posts that link other posts inside your blog.</span>. :)</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot of what mentions/backlinks will look like in a page:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/backlinks.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<p>In the above example, it can be seen that there are three links, it means that all the three pages have a link to the page in which they are being displayed as a backlink.</p>\n\n<p>For eg. If you scroll all the way to the bottom, you will something similar i.e., you will see a link to the pages that has a link to this page.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sidenotes-and-marginnotes\">Sidenotes and Marginnotes</h2>\n\n<p>Of what use are such wide margins when you can't make efficient use of them. Fear not, we have a way to handle that too — Marginnotes<label for=\"rmn-1\" class=\"margin-toggle  \">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"rmn-1\" class=\"margin-toggle\"/><span class=\"mn-right\">There are two types of people, those who have taste and those who don't. And anyone who has even a tiny bit of taste will never, never-ever use footnotes over sidenotes.<br /><cite>—Some random blogger who shall remain unamed</cite></span>. For what it's worth, when you stroll down a garden, you don't ever see a flower bloom 10 miles away from the plant do you? This is where sidenotes come in and replace their paper-era sibling ie., footnotes. If it is relevant you see it right there. (No scrolling = No cognitive strain). The entire idea is to allow users to have a pleasant time on your blog i.e., Not too distracting(offputting), not too mesmerizing, just the right amount of ornamentation to allow seamless reading experience<label for=\"lsn-2\" class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number \"></label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"lsn-2\" class=\"margin-toggle\"/><span class=\"sn-left\">I see it as an issue of managing &amp; exposing the length. Some readers want to go as deep as you can take them, but others are frustrated if you block them from moving on. I deal with it by use of collapsible sections+abstracts, margin notes, and explicit topics in list items.<br /><cite>—Tweet by Gwern Branwen</cite></span>. The added advantage we have with this website is it has wide margins allowing us to use both sides for sidenotes. So we can use them for quotations, small snippets, and also for interactive/expository animations.</p>\n\n<p>The first one on the right is a marginnote and the second one on the left is a sidenote. You may ask what is the difference, it looks all the same to me. You are right to some extent, but if you look closely you will see that the one on left has a number attached to it while the one on the right doesn't. Yes, that is all the difference there is, at least <a href=\"https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/\">Edward Tufte<sup ><i class=\"fa fa-github\"></i></sup></a> says.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"on-feed-context-menu\">On-feed context menu</h2>\n\n<p>Context menus are a great way to improve user experience if they are done correctly. Given that our theme has a feed-link structure for the landing page, it leverages the opportunity and saves second time visitors who have already read the article and are only here to see other related articles or the backlinks by just simply right clicking on the feed. Thereby saving users the unnecessay time involved with clicking on a link and scrolling all the way down to see the backlinks or related articles.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot for people who are too lazy, while the rest of you can go back to the home page and try it out by right clicking on a particular feed entry:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/context_menu.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd; fload: left;\" height=\"70%\" width=\"45%\" />\n<img src=\"/assets/img/context_menu_backlinks.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"70%\" width=\"45%\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"on-hover-page-preview\">On-hover page preview</h2>\n\n<p>Ever been to a blog or a tutorial site and seen links to other pages without any clue as to what that page is about apart from vague statements like \"See Related\" or \"Click here for Part II\". We all have had that experience, haven't we? Wouldn't it be nice to be able to take a cursory glance at the page just so that you could get a feel of it and decide quickly as to whether or not do you really want to read that post without having to click on the link and wait for the ginormous scroll of text to load? That is precisely what page previews are for. For eg, try to hover over this link: <a style=\"background-color:#ffffc4;\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">Serendipity Based outlook as a driver for large Scale personal projects</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, all of what you see is available right out of the box. No configuration, no sh*t, no shinola.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transclusion\">Transclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Once I had sidenotes and page preview for my blog, transclusion<label for=\"rmn-transclude-3\" class=\"margin-toggle  \">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"rmn-transclude-3\" class=\"margin-toggle\"/><span class=\"mn-right\"><a href=\"\"> <span style=\"background-color: #ffffc4; color: #555;\">Transclusion</span><br/><b>Serendipity Based outlook as a driver for large Scale personal projects</b><br/></a></span> just felt like the natural next step to it. I mean there are less important pages that you can leave at the discretion of the readers to hover-over and take a peak, and then there are pages that you want to explicity show a glimpse of, but how do you do it? Obviously, putting a chunk of random text in the most of your post is just unacceptable UX, but then how else do you do it? You could just combine the nifty little preview thingy with your nice little sidenote thingy and let users get a glimpse of the important stuff without getting distracted. Amazing, isn't it?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"link-management\">Link Management</h2>\n\n<p>Now the biggest of them all: the permalink curse. Most of us are never happy with the first title that we come up with, and when you excitingly write a new post embedding an old post—the title of which you always wanted to change but never got time to do so because you were busy creating content—it sometimes happens that you forget to update the relevant link all the associated places that you linked it in. And I think this is worst of them all in terms of an UX nightmare.</p>\n\n<p>Although we don't have a complete solution given that we are using a static site generator, I think we have a decent mechanism to atleast find the culprit links without clicking at them (a.k.a highlighting links that don't point anywhere, but ideally must be pointing to some location due to which they cannot be deleted).</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A perfectly valid link: <span class=\"infotip\"><a href=\"/notes/comparison-based-accomplishment\">Comparison based on accomplishment does not have a baseline</a><span class=\"right bottom\"><span class=\"infotip-title\">Comparison based on accomplishment does not have a baseline</span><br/><span class=\"infotip-excerpt\">I would just note that you have an image of some \"great X\" that you are trying to live up to, when really, there is no frame of reference to standardize a measure for X. Point being you and your circumstances are completely unique[[Warren Buffet talks about the idea of maintaining an inner score card of principles to escape this girardian mimetic rat-race::rmn]]. Also, James Richardon, the poet, says this beautifully in his book \"Vectors: Aphorisms and 10 Second Essays\":<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n  “He wants to know...</span><i></i></span></span></li>\n  <li>A bad link that does not point anywhere: <a style=\"background-color:#ffffc4;\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">Some non-existing title</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See how it highlights in yellow? I feel this is a game-changer that anyone who has a personal website should at least think of incorporating in their website given the number of deadlink issues we face.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This only works with local/internal links.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"miscellaneous-features-highlighting-text-primitive-flash-cards-and-some-gimmicks\">Miscellaneous Features: Highlighting text, Primitive Flash Cards, and Some gimmicks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"text-highlighting\">Text Highlighting</h3>\n\n<p>So you are writing an essay and you want to emphasize a particular portion of your essay to your audience that you think is just mindblowing. Tools like Medium provide such an easy way to do this while we still keep scratching our head with mark tags and p tag with a background color and what not.. Worry not, this theme allows you to easily highlight a portion of a text without any hassle.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of it:</p>\n\n<p class=\"boxit\">\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

I have a half-hour morning routine that I follow dilligently in going through the scheduled anki decks to strengthen my neuronal connection on a particular topic/subject. And I have been doing it consistently for almost a year now. This is an attempt at recreating the aspect of spaced-repetition to allow my brain to form interesting connections based on things I have already written. The plan is to extend it using local storage and somekind of firebase like service to provide a constant reminder to users using the supermemo algorithm, but as of now, this is where I stand — a simple on-click card to keep the thing going until I build something better.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example(click on the card):</p>\n\n<p>\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, <label for=\"srs-0\" class=\"srs-toggle \"><svg class=\"srs-svg\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" height=\"20\" width=\"18\" viewBox=\"0 0 100 125\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 100 100\" xml:space=\"preserve\"><path fill=\"none\" d=\"M41.648,12.407c-0.186-0.286-0.5-0.457-0.841-0.457c-0.191,0-0.379,0.056-0.542,0.162l-5.235,3.396l8.239-0.602  L41.648,12.407z\"/><path fill=\"none\" d=\"M28.45,19.776L8.471,32.737c-0.462,0.3-0.594,0.921-0.294,1.384l23.832,36.736l-3.638-49.85  C28.34,20.584,28.379,20.176,28.45,19.776z\"/><path d=\"M40.055,81.425l0.127-0.082l-1.181,0.086C39.319,81.615,39.731,81.635,40.055,81.425z\"/><path d=\"M94.964,32.733c-0.616-1.185-1.656-2.06-2.93-2.462l-15.315-4.845l-0.576-7.905c-0.2-2.721-2.604-4.834-5.352-4.623  l-22.969,1.676l-2.818-4.344c-0.925-1.428-2.495-2.28-4.197-2.28c-0.966,0-1.907,0.279-2.719,0.806L6.294,29.381  c-2.313,1.5-2.974,4.603-1.473,6.916l30.496,47.008c0.926,1.428,2.495,2.28,4.198,2.28c0.965,0,1.905-0.278,2.717-0.806l1.04-0.675  l28.847,9.123c0.491,0.155,0.999,0.233,1.511,0.233c2.191,0,4.105-1.404,4.764-3.491l16.902-53.424  C95.697,35.273,95.58,33.919,94.964,32.733z M40.266,12.112c0.163-0.106,0.35-0.162,0.542-0.162c0.341,0,0.656,0.17,0.841,0.457  l1.622,2.5l-8.239,0.602L40.266,12.112z M8.177,34.121c-0.3-0.463-0.168-1.083,0.294-1.384l19.979-12.96  c-0.071,0.399-0.11,0.808-0.08,1.23l3.638,49.85L8.177,34.121z M35.678,66.191L32.36,20.716c-0.04-0.55,0.375-1.031,0.924-1.071  l12.471-0.909l4.552-0.332l20.852-1.52c0.519,0,0.955,0.408,0.993,0.928l0.461,6.315L55.9,18.841  c-0.49-0.155-0.997-0.234-1.508-0.234c-1.206,0-2.32,0.437-3.195,1.169c-0.715,0.597-1.274,1.385-1.571,2.324l-0.554,1.75  L35.678,66.191z M91.48,35.34l-11.408,36.06l-2.057,6.5l-3.438,10.867c-0.194,0.614-0.798,0.794-1.253,0.647l-25.706-8.13  l-1.247-0.394l-3.694-1.169l-5.488-1.735c-0.343-0.108-0.514-0.355-0.586-0.493c-0.061-0.116-0.137-0.342-0.093-0.617  c0.007-0.047,0.011-0.093,0.026-0.143l15.354-48.536l1.547-4.891c0.005-0.016,0.016-0.026,0.021-0.041  c0.166-0.451,0.579-0.659,0.932-0.659c0.101,0,0.202,0.016,0.301,0.047l18.233,5.768l4.105,1.299l13.795,4.364  c0.345,0.109,0.516,0.356,0.588,0.494C91.486,34.715,91.59,34.997,91.48,35.34z\"/><path d=\"M40.055,81.425c-0.323,0.21-0.735,0.19-1.054,0.004l1.181-0.086L40.055,81.425z\"/></svg></label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"srs-0\" class=\"srs-toggle\"/><span class=\"spaced-rep\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: #555;\"><u><strong>Flashcard</strong></u></span><br/>consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor</span> incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

So that's that.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-gimmicks\">The Gimmicks</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"profile-board-for-main-site\">Profile Board for Main Site</h4>\n\n<p>If you have ever used a social media with feeds you probably have stalked the profiles of people you find interesting, but the problem is as much as the mystery gets someone into look at your profile, it also makes them form opinions. If the profile reads author, you see their feed one way; and if it says scientist from Caltech, you see it the other. I mean as much as authority is a thing to form opinions about, it also alienates people from what could potentially have been a great relation if not for the credentiality and appearance. So, the idea with the profile board was to get done with this stuff right away so that people can enjoy the content instead of going profile hunting on your credibility and accomplishments and appearances to judge and validate their opinions by validating you.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/profile_board.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"omnisearch-bar\">Omnisearch bar</h4>\n\n<p>This is inspired by the browsers like Chrome and Firefox where the searchbar is always placed at the top so that readers can easily search for the next thing without having to go back to the main page and scroll through dozens of articles.</p>\n\n<p>And I personally like this one because, it allows me as an author/writer to quickly jump between different posts while I am reading my articles to reference in my other articles.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/search.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The searchbar is not implemented as a scrollspying widget that pins itself automatically is because I have a preference for distraction free content when reading, that is why the website provides a chevron to scroll to the top easily instead of pinning the search to the header.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"feed-like-structure\">Feed-like structure</h4>\n\n<p>I am a big fan of Aza Raskin's infinite scroll design and the fact that it provides such an easy way to engage users is just mind-blowing. That said, I must also confess that I am not a big fan of infinite scrolls on social media websites given their addictive nature. Blogs are fundamentally finite in nature. I mean even if you are a highly productive individual who writes a thousand page essay a day, you would have only written 365 essays and not all of them interesting to me. So having a feed-like structure on blogs I feel is fundamental to allowing users to engage in a more neutral way.</p>\n\n<p>And if you are still not sure of its utility, go join twitter or facebook or instagram, and comeback to read this again after a month or so.</p>\n\n<p>Untill then here is the screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/feed.png\" style=\"box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"auto-tagging-wip-posts-on-the-feed\">Auto-tagging WIP posts on the feed</h4>\n\n<p>Sometimes you are writing something interesting but have not completed the entire thing, lets say like a series of posts on single, it can be helpful to show users right away on the feed/homepage the status so that when they click the post, their expectations are already managed.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/ongoing.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"clickable-tags\">Clickable tags</h4>\n\n<p>If you go the posts on the homepage, and go inside any of them and try to click on the tags such as date or category, you will see that it takes you to a page with all the posts belonging to that tag or date. Just a nifty little feature.</p>\n\n<p>And that is all! Thanks for scrolling all the way through to see all the features.

Once you figure out which class to use, all you have to do is just add the class before the text you want inside a curl brace like this ​{:&lt;classnames-with-dot-prepended-to-them&gt;​}</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"8-other-implicit-features\">8. Other implicit features.</h3>\n\n<p>Features like backlinks, context menu, related posts, page preview are available by default as they are implemented using CSS and JS. So, you don't have to do anything other than write as you would normally to make use of those features.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<p>When you typeout square brackets, it can be frustrating to type out the entire file title everytime. At least it was for me, so I created a small VSCode plugin, the editor in which I write my essays to autocomplete the titles as soon as I type double squarebrackets. It has been pretty handy for me, if you are interested in using VSCode or already use it, you can find it here: [[Notecomplete::https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/scratchpad/tree/master/note-complete]]. It is pretty simple to use, all you have to do is just download the note-complete folder and copy it to .vscode directory in your OS to start using it. :)</p>\n\n<p>For setting up the theme on your

So, you don't have to do anything other than write as you would normally to make use of those features.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<p>When you typeout square brackets, it can be frustrating to type out the entire file title everytime. At least it was for me, so I created a small VSCode plugin, the editor in which I write my essays to autocomplete the titles as soon as I type double squarebrackets. It has been pretty handy for me, if you are interested in using VSCode or already use it, you can find it here: <a href=\"https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/scratchpad/tree/master/note-complete\">Notecomplete<sup ><i class=\"fa fa-github\"></i></sup></a>. It is pretty simple to use, all you have to do is just download the note-complete folder and copy it to .vscode directory in your OS to start using it. :)</p>\n\n<p>For setting up the theme on your website checkout <a style=\"background-color:#ffffc4;\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">How to setup Enjoyment work</a></p>\n\n</div><div class=\"row\" id=\"author\">\n        <!-- <div class=\"col-xl-3 col-12\">\n            <img src=\"https://brennanbrown.ca/img/avatar.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail d-block mx-auto\"/>\n        </div> -->\n        <div class=\"col-xl-9 col-12\" id=\"author-text\">\n            <h2 class=\"text-lg-left text-center\">\n                About\n                DonGato\n            </h2>\n            <p>\n                A digital nomad.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div><!-- BACKLINKS --><div class=\"related\" id=\"jekyll-seamless-backlinks\">\n        <h2>Linked References</h2>\n        <div class=\"related-wrapper\"><div class=\"related-group\">\n                            <a href=\"/posts/Exploring-the-features-of-enjoyment-work\">\n                                <p class=\"related-title\">Exploring the features of Enjoyment work</p>\n                                <p class=\"related-excerpt\">Introduction\n\nEssentiality is the heart of any good software, and this theme is designed to ensure that I don't add things that I won't u...</p>\n                            </a>\n                        </div></div>\n        <br/>\n    </div><!-- RELATED POSTS --><div class=\"related\" id=\"jekyll-seamless-relatedposts\">\n            <h2>Related Posts</h2>\n            <div class=\"related-wrapper\"><div class=\"related-group\">\n                            <a href=\"/posts/Introduction-to-enjoyment-work\">\n                                <p class=\"related-title\">Introduction to Enjoyment work</p>\n                                <p class=\"related-excerpt\">Enjoyment work is a highly functional jekyll-based theme that combines the best of different worlds (atleast tries to 😅).

It has been designed carefully to get rid of all the feature creeps, bloatwares, etc. i.e., no bootstrap, no semantic, no jquery, no nothing…</p>\n\n<p>That said, this is a ready made theme and I am making it public so that more number of people will use it and enjoy the experience of using it. So, pardon my bigotry there😅.</p>\n\n<p>As for the list of features, this website steals features from every website that I can think of, or more appropriately the design inspiration for this website is derived from multiple sources; Here is the tiny list for the curious:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Backlinks: Roam Research</li>\n  <li>Transclusion: Tiddlywiki</li>\n  <li>Sidenote: Edward Tufte, Gwern Branwen</li>\n  <li>Stale Link Highlighting: Tiddlywiki</li>\n  <li>Wiki-style links: Every wiki ever</li>\n  <li>Text highlighting: Roam Research</li>\n  <li>Page preview: Wikipedia</li>\n  <li>Context menu: Google Docs</li>\n  <li>Notes: Andy Matuschak's Evergreen Notes</li>\n  <li>Color scheme: Github</li>\n  <li>Feed like structure for home page: Twitter</li>\n  <li>Omnisearch box at the top: Google</li>\n  <li>Profile board: Twitter/Instagram</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now that you know all my secrets let us not waste any more time into further exposing my true nature in its entirety and get started with tour:P</p>\n\n<p class=\"boxit\"><strong>Note:</strong> This page only showcases the features. How to use these feature is mentioned in a separate article.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"backlinks\">Backlinks</h2>\n\n<p>Backlinks or as Roam Research calls it \"Birdirectional Links\" is a nifty little feature that allows not only users reading your essays/articles to encounter interesting related articles, this is something you as a author yourself will see how powerful it is once you start browsing around your website. Backlinks are basically a link on PostA indicating all the mentions of PostA on different Posts.</p>\n\n<p>The neat stuff is it won't show up with an empty box if a given post doesn't have any backlinks and if it is already included in backlinks, it won't show up in your related posts[[<strong>Related Posts:</strong> Posts that share same tag(s).<br /> <strong>Linked References(Backlinks):</strong> Posts that link other posts inside your blog.::rmn]]. :)</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot of what mentions/backlinks will look like in a page:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/backlinks.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<p>In the above example, it can be seen that there are three links, it means that all the three pages have a link to the page in which they are being displayed as a backlink.</p>\n\n<p>For eg. If you scroll all the way to the bottom, you will something similar i.e., you will see a link to the pages that has a link to this page.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sidenotes-and-marginnotes\">Sidenotes and Marginnotes</h2>\n\n<p>Of what use are such wide margins when you can't make efficient use of them. Fear not, we have a way to handle that too — Marginnotes[[There are two types of people, those who have taste and those who don't. And anyone who has even a tiny bit of taste will never, never-ever use footnotes over sidenotes.<br /><cite>—Some random blogger who shall remain unamed</cite>::rmn]]. For what it's worth, when you stroll down a garden, you don't ever see a flower bloom 10 miles away from the plant do you? This is where sidenotes come in and replace their paper-era sibling ie., footnotes. If it is relevant you see it right there. (No scrolling = No cognitive strain). The entire idea is to allow users to have a pleasant time on your blog i.e., Not too distracting(offputting), not too mesmerizing, just the right amount of ornamentation to allow seamless reading experience[[I see it as an issue of managing &amp; exposing the length. Some readers want to go as deep as you can take them, but others are frustrated if you block them from moving on. I deal with it by use of collapsible sections+abstracts, margin notes, and explicit topics in list items.<br /><cite>—Tweet by Gwern Branwen</cite>::lsn]]. The added advantage we have with this website is it has wide margins allowing us to use both sides for sidenotes. So we can use them for quotations, small snippets, and also for interactive/expository animations.</p>\n\n<p>The first one on the right is a marginnote and the second one on the left is a sidenote. You may ask what is the difference, it looks all the same to me. You are right to some extent, but if you look closely you will see that the one on left has a number attached to it while the one on the right doesn't. Yes, that is all the difference there is, at least [[Edward Tufte::https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/]] says.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"on-feed-context-menu\">On-feed context menu</h2>\n\n<p>Context menus are a great way to improve user experience if they are done correctly. Given that our theme has a feed-link structure for the landing page, it leverages the opportunity and saves second time visitors who have already read the article and are only here to see other related articles or the backlinks by just simply right clicking on the feed. Thereby saving users the unnecessay time involved with clicking on a link and scrolling all the way down to see the backlinks or related articles.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot for people who are too lazy, while the rest of you can go back to the home page and try it out by right clicking on a particular feed entry:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/context_menu.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd; fload: left;\" height=\"70%\" width=\"45%\" />\n<img src=\"/assets/img/context_menu_backlinks.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"70%\" width=\"45%\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"on-hover-page-preview\">On-hover page preview</h2>\n\n<p>Ever been to a blog or a tutorial site and seen links to other pages without any clue as to what that page is about apart from vague statements like \"See Related\" or \"Click here for Part II\". We all have had that experience, haven't we? Wouldn't it be nice to be able to take a cursory glance at the page just so that you could get a feel of it and decide quickly as to whether or not do you really want to read that post without having to click on the link and wait for the ginormous scroll of text to load? That is precisely what page previews are for. For eg, try to hover over this link: [[Serendipity Based outlook as a driver for large Scale personal projects]].</p>\n\n<p>And yes, all of what you see is available right out of the box. No configuration, no sh*t, no shinola.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transclusion\">Transclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Once I had sidenotes and page preview for my blog, transclusion[[Serendipity Based outlook as a driver for large Scale personal projects::rmn-transclude]] just felt like the natural next step to it. I mean there are less important pages that you can leave at the discretion of the readers to hover-over and take a peak, and then there are pages that you want to explicity show a glimpse of, but how do you do it? Obviously, putting a chunk of random text in the most of your post is just unacceptable UX, but then how else do you do it? You could just combine the nifty little preview thingy with your nice little sidenote thingy and let users get a glimpse of the important stuff without getting distracted. Amazing, isn't it?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"link-management\">Link Management</h2>\n\n<p>Now the biggest of them all: the permalink curse. Most of us are never happy with the first title that we come up with, and when you excitingly write a new post embedding an old post—the title of which you always wanted to change but never got time to do so because you were busy creating content—it sometimes happens that you forget to update the relevant link all the associated places that you linked it in. And I think this is worst of them all in terms of an UX nightmare.</p>\n\n<p>Although we don't have a complete solution given that we are using a static site generator, I think we have a decent mechanism to atleast find the culprit links without clicking at them (a.k.a highlighting links that don't point anywhere, but ideally must be pointing to some location due to which they cannot be deleted).</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A perfectly valid link: [[Comparison based on accomplishment does not have a baseline]]</li>\n  <li>A bad link that does not point anywhere: [[Some non-existing title]]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See how it highlights in yellow? I feel this is a game-changer that anyone who has a personal website should at least think of incorporating in their website given the number of deadlink issues we face.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This only works with local/internal links.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"miscellaneous-features-highlighting-text-primitive-flash-cards-and-some-gimmicks\">Miscellaneous Features: Highlighting text, Primitive Flash Cards, and Some gimmicks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"text-highlighting\">Text Highlighting</h3>\n\n<p>So you are writing an essay and you want to emphasize a particular portion of your essay to your audience that you think is just mindblowing. Tools like Medium provide such an easy way to do this while we still keep scratching our head with mark tags and p tag with a background color and what not.. Worry not, this theme allows you to easily highlight a portion of a text without any hassle.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of it:</p>\n\n<p class=\"boxit\">\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

I have a half-hour morning routine that I follow dilligently in going through the scheduled anki decks to strengthen my neuronal connection on a particular topic/subject. And I have been doing it consistently for almost a year now. This is an attempt at recreating the aspect of spaced-repetition to allow my brain to form interesting connections based on things I have already written. The plan is to extend it using local storage and somekind of firebase like service to provide a constant reminder to users using the supermemo algorithm, but as of now, this is where I stand — a simple on-click card to keep the thing going until I build something better.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example(click on the card):</p>\n\n<p>\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, [[consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor::srs]] incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

If the profile reads author, you see their feed one way; and if it says scientist from Caltech, you see it the other. I mean as much as authority is a thing to form opinions about, it also alienates people from what could potentially have been a great relation if not for the credentiality and appearance. So, the idea with the profile board was to get done with this stuff right away so that people can enjoy the content instead of going profile hunting on your credibility and accomplishments and appearances to judge and validate their opinions by validating you.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/profile_board.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"omnisearch-bar\">Omnisearch bar</h4>\n\n<p>This is inspired by the browsers like Chrome and Firefox where the searchbar is always placed at the top so that readers can easily search for the next thing without having to go back to the main page and scroll through dozens of articles.</p>\n\n<p>And I personally like this one because, it allows me as an author/writer to quickly jump between different posts while I am reading my articles to reference in my other articles.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/search.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The searchbar is not implemented as a scrollspying widget that pins itself automatically is because I have a preference for distraction free content when reading, that is why the website provides a chevron to scroll to the top easily instead of pinning the search to the header.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"feed-like-structure\">Feed-like structure</h4>\n\n<p>I am a big fan of Aza Raskin's infinite scroll design and the fact that it provides such an easy way to engage users is just mind-blowing. That said, I must also confess that I am not a big fan of infinite scrolls on social media websites given their addictive nature. Blogs are fundamentally finite in nature. I mean even if you are a highly productive individual who writes a thousand page essay a day, you would have only written 365 essays and not all of them interesting to me. So having a feed-like structure on blogs I feel is fundamental to allowing users to engage in a more neutral way.</p>\n\n<p>And if you are still not sure of its utility, go join twitter or facebook or instagram, and comeback to read this again after a month or so.</p>\n\n<p>Untill then here is the screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/feed.png\" style=\"box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"auto-tagging-wip-posts-on-the-feed\">Auto-tagging WIP posts on the feed</h4>\n\n<p>Sometimes you are writing something interesting but have not completed the entire thing, lets say like a series of posts on single, it can be helpful to show users right away on the feed/homepage the status so that when they click the post, their expectations are already managed.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/ongoing.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"clickable-tags\">Clickable tags</h4>\n\n<p>If you go the posts on the homepage, and go inside any of them and try to click on the tags such as date or category, you will see that it takes you to a page with all the posts belonging to that tag or date. Just a nifty little feature.</p>\n\n<p>And that is all! Thanks for scrolling all the way through to see all the features.

It has been designed carefully to get rid of all the feature creeps, bloatwares, etc. i.e., no bootstrap, no semantic, no jquery, no nothing…</p>\n\n<p>That said, this is a ready made theme and I am making it public so that more number of people will use it and enjoy the experience of using it. So, pardon my bigotry there😅.</p>\n\n<p>As for the list of features, this website steals features from every website that I can think of, or more appropriately the design inspiration for this website is derived from multiple sources; Here is the tiny list for the curious:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Backlinks: Roam Research</li>\n  <li>Transclusion: Tiddlywiki</li>\n  <li>Sidenote: Edward Tufte, Gwern Branwen</li>\n  <li>Stale Link Highlighting: Tiddlywiki</li>\n  <li>Wiki-style links: Every wiki ever</li>\n  <li>Text highlighting: Roam Research</li>\n  <li>Page preview: Wikipedia</li>\n  <li>Context menu: Google Docs</li>\n  <li>Notes: Andy Matuschak's Evergreen Notes</li>\n  <li>Color scheme: Github</li>\n  <li>Feed like structure for home page: Twitter</li>\n  <li>Omnisearch box at the top: Google</li>\n  <li>Profile board: Twitter/Instagram</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now that you know all my secrets let us not waste any more time into further exposing my true nature in its entirety and get started with tour:P</p>\n\n<p class=\"boxit\"><strong>Note:</strong> This page only showcases the features. How to use these feature is mentioned in a separate article.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"backlinks\">Backlinks</h2>\n\n<p>Backlinks or as Roam Research calls it \"Birdirectional Links\" is a nifty little feature that allows not only users reading your essays/articles to encounter interesting related articles, this is something you as a author yourself will see how powerful it is once you start browsing around your website. Backlinks are basically a link on PostA indicating all the mentions of PostA on different Posts.</p>\n\n<p>The neat stuff is it won't show up with an empty box if a given post doesn't have any backlinks and if it is already included in backlinks, it won't show up in your related posts<label for=\"rmn-0\" class=\"margin-toggle  \">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"rmn-0\" class=\"margin-toggle\"/><span class=\"mn-right\"><strong>Related Posts:</strong> Posts that share same tag(s).<br /> <strong>Linked References(Backlinks):</strong> Posts that link other posts inside your blog.</span>. :)</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot of what mentions/backlinks will look like in a page:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/backlinks.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<p>In the above example, it can be seen that there are three links, it means that all the three pages have a link to the page in which they are being displayed as a backlink.</p>\n\n<p>For eg. If you scroll all the way to the bottom, you will something similar i.e., you will see a link to the pages that has a link to this page.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sidenotes-and-marginnotes\">Sidenotes and Marginnotes</h2>\n\n<p>Of what use are such wide margins when you can't make efficient use of them. Fear not, we have a way to handle that too — Marginnotes<label for=\"rmn-1\" class=\"margin-toggle  \">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"rmn-1\" class=\"margin-toggle\"/><span class=\"mn-right\">There are two types of people, those who have taste and those who don't. And anyone who has even a tiny bit of taste will never, never-ever use footnotes over sidenotes.<br /><cite>—Some random blogger who shall remain unamed</cite></span>. For what it's worth, when you stroll down a garden, you don't ever see a flower bloom 10 miles away from the plant do you? This is where sidenotes come in and replace their paper-era sibling ie., footnotes. If it is relevant you see it right there. (No scrolling = No cognitive strain). The entire idea is to allow users to have a pleasant time on your blog i.e., Not too distracting(offputting), not too mesmerizing, just the right amount of ornamentation to allow seamless reading experience<label for=\"lsn-2\" class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number \"></label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"lsn-2\" class=\"margin-toggle\"/><span class=\"sn-left\">I see it as an issue of managing &amp; exposing the length. Some readers want to go as deep as you can take them, but others are frustrated if you block them from moving on. I deal with it by use of collapsible sections+abstracts, margin notes, and explicit topics in list items.<br /><cite>—Tweet by Gwern Branwen</cite></span>. The added advantage we have with this website is it has wide margins allowing us to use both sides for sidenotes. So we can use them for quotations, small snippets, and also for interactive/expository animations.</p>\n\n<p>The first one on the right is a marginnote and the second one on the left is a sidenote. You may ask what is the difference, it looks all the same to me. You are right to some extent, but if you look closely you will see that the one on left has a number attached to it while the one on the right doesn't. Yes, that is all the difference there is, at least <a href=\"https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/\">Edward Tufte<sup ><i class=\"fa fa-github\"></i></sup></a> says.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"on-feed-context-menu\">On-feed context menu</h2>\n\n<p>Context menus are a great way to improve user experience if they are done correctly. Given that our theme has a feed-link structure for the landing page, it leverages the opportunity and saves second time visitors who have already read the article and are only here to see other related articles or the backlinks by just simply right clicking on the feed. Thereby saving users the unnecessay time involved with clicking on a link and scrolling all the way down to see the backlinks or related articles.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot for people who are too lazy, while the rest of you can go back to the home page and try it out by right clicking on a particular feed entry:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/context_menu.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd; fload: left;\" height=\"70%\" width=\"45%\" />\n<img src=\"/assets/img/context_menu_backlinks.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"70%\" width=\"45%\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"on-hover-page-preview\">On-hover page preview</h2>\n\n<p>Ever been to a blog or a tutorial site and seen links to other pages without any clue as to what that page is about apart from vague statements like \"See Related\" or \"Click here for Part II\". We all have had that experience, haven't we? Wouldn't it be nice to be able to take a cursory glance at the page just so that you could get a feel of it and decide quickly as to whether or not do you really want to read that post without having to click on the link and wait for the ginormous scroll of text to load? That is precisely what page previews are for. For eg, try to hover over this link: <a style=\"background-color:#ffffc4;\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">Serendipity Based outlook as a driver for large Scale personal projects</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, all of what you see is available right out of the box. No configuration, no sh*t, no shinola.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transclusion\">Transclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Once I had sidenotes and page preview for my blog, transclusion<label for=\"rmn-transclude-3\" class=\"margin-toggle  \">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"rmn-transclude-3\" class=\"margin-toggle\"/><span class=\"mn-right\"><a href=\"\"> <span style=\"background-color: #ffffc4; color: #555;\">Transclusion</span><br/><b>Serendipity Based outlook as a driver for large Scale personal projects</b><br/></a></span> just felt like the natural next step to it. I mean there are less important pages that you can leave at the discretion of the readers to hover-over and take a peak, and then there are pages that you want to explicity show a glimpse of, but how do you do it? Obviously, putting a chunk of random text in the most of your post is just unacceptable UX, but then how else do you do it? You could just combine the nifty little preview thingy with your nice little sidenote thingy and let users get a glimpse of the important stuff without getting distracted. Amazing, isn't it?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"link-management\">Link Management</h2>\n\n<p>Now the biggest of them all: the permalink curse. Most of us are never happy with the first title that we come up with, and when you excitingly write a new post embedding an old post—the title of which you always wanted to change but never got time to do so because you were busy creating content—it sometimes happens that you forget to update the relevant link all the associated places that you linked it in. And I think this is worst of them all in terms of an UX nightmare.</p>\n\n<p>Although we don't have a complete solution given that we are using a static site generator, I think we have a decent mechanism to atleast find the culprit links without clicking at them (a.k.a highlighting links that don't point anywhere, but ideally must be pointing to some location due to which they cannot be deleted).</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A perfectly valid link: <span class=\"infotip\"><a href=\"/notes/comparison-based-accomplishment\">Comparison based on accomplishment does not have a baseline</a><span class=\"right bottom\"><span class=\"infotip-title\">Comparison based on accomplishment does not have a baseline</span><br/><span class=\"infotip-excerpt\">I would just note that you have an image of some \"great X\" that you are trying to live up to, when really, there is no frame of reference to standardize a measure for X. Point being you and your circumstances are completely unique[[Warren Buffet talks about the idea of maintaining an inner score card of principles to escape this girardian mimetic rat-race::rmn]].

Tools like Medium provide such an easy way to do this while we still keep scratching our head with mark tags and p tag with a background color and what not.. Worry not, this theme allows you to easily highlight a portion of a text without any hassle.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of it:</p>\n\n<p class=\"boxit\">\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

I have a half-hour morning routine that I follow dilligently in going through the scheduled anki decks to strengthen my neuronal connection on a particular topic/subject. And I have been doing it consistently for almost a year now. This is an attempt at recreating the aspect of spaced-repetition to allow my brain to form interesting connections based on things I have already written. The plan is to extend it using local storage and somekind of firebase like service to provide a constant reminder to users using the supermemo algorithm, but as of now, this is where I stand — a simple on-click card to keep the thing going until I build something better.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example(click on the card):</p>\n\n<p>\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, <label for=\"srs-0\" class=\"srs-toggle \"><svg class=\"srs-svg\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" height=\"20\" width=\"18\" viewBox=\"0 0 100 125\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 100 100\" xml:space=\"preserve\"><path fill=\"none\" d=\"M41.648,12.407c-0.186-0.286-0.5-0.457-0.841-0.457c-0.191,0-0.379,0.056-0.542,0.162l-5.235,3.396l8.239-0.602  L41.648,12.407z\"/><path fill=\"none\" d=\"M28.45,19.776L8.471,32.737c-0.462,0.3-0.594,0.921-0.294,1.384l23.832,36.736l-3.638-49.85  C28.34,20.584,28.379,20.176,28.45,19.776z\"/><path d=\"M40.055,81.425l0.127-0.082l-1.181,0.086C39.319,81.615,39.731,81.635,40.055,81.425z\"/><path d=\"M94.964,32.733c-0.616-1.185-1.656-2.06-2.93-2.462l-15.315-4.845l-0.576-7.905c-0.2-2.721-2.604-4.834-5.352-4.623  l-22.969,1.676l-2.818-4.344c-0.925-1.428-2.495-2.28-4.197-2.28c-0.966,0-1.907,0.279-2.719,0.806L6.294,29.381  c-2.313,1.5-2.974,4.603-1.473,6.916l30.496,47.008c0.926,1.428,2.495,2.28,4.198,2.28c0.965,0,1.905-0.278,2.717-0.806l1.04-0.675  l28.847,9.123c0.491,0.155,0.999,0.233,1.511,0.233c2.191,0,4.105-1.404,4.764-3.491l16.902-53.424  C95.697,35.273,95.58,33.919,94.964,32.733z M40.266,12.112c0.163-0.106,0.35-0.162,0.542-0.162c0.341,0,0.656,0.17,0.841,0.457  l1.622,2.5l-8.239,0.602L40.266,12.112z M8.177,34.121c-0.3-0.463-0.168-1.083,0.294-1.384l19.979-12.96  c-0.071,0.399-0.11,0.808-0.08,1.23l3.638,49.85L8.177,34.121z M35.678,66.191L32.36,20.716c-0.04-0.55,0.375-1.031,0.924-1.071  l12.471-0.909l4.552-0.332l20.852-1.52c0.519,0,0.955,0.408,0.993,0.928l0.461,6.315L55.9,18.841  c-0.49-0.155-0.997-0.234-1.508-0.234c-1.206,0-2.32,0.437-3.195,1.169c-0.715,0.597-1.274,1.385-1.571,2.324l-0.554,1.75  L35.678,66.191z M91.48,35.34l-11.408,36.06l-2.057,6.5l-3.438,10.867c-0.194,0.614-0.798,0.794-1.253,0.647l-25.706-8.13  l-1.247-0.394l-3.694-1.169l-5.488-1.735c-0.343-0.108-0.514-0.355-0.586-0.493c-0.061-0.116-0.137-0.342-0.093-0.617  c0.007-0.047,0.011-0.093,0.026-0.143l15.354-48.536l1.547-4.891c0.005-0.016,0.016-0.026,0.021-0.041  c0.166-0.451,0.579-0.659,0.932-0.659c0.101,0,0.202,0.016,0.301,0.047l18.233,5.768l4.105,1.299l13.795,4.364  c0.345,0.109,0.516,0.356,0.588,0.494C91.486,34.715,91.59,34.997,91.48,35.34z\"/><path d=\"M40.055,81.425c-0.323,0.21-0.735,0.19-1.054,0.004l1.181-0.086L40.055,81.425z\"/></svg></label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"srs-0\" class=\"srs-toggle\"/><span class=\"spaced-rep\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: #555;\"><u><strong>Flashcard</strong></u></span><br/>consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor</span> incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

So that's that.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-gimmicks\">The Gimmicks</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"profile-board-for-main-site\">Profile Board for Main Site</h4>\n\n<p>If you have ever used a social media with feeds you probably have stalked the profiles of people you find interesting, but the problem is as much as the mystery gets someone into look at your profile, it also makes them form opinions. If the profile reads author, you see their feed one way; and if it says scientist from Caltech, you see it the other. I mean as much as authority is a thing to form opinions about, it also alienates people from what could potentially have been a great relation if not for the credentiality and appearance. So, the idea with the profile board was to get done with this stuff right away so that people can enjoy the content instead of going profile hunting on your credibility and accomplishments and appearances to judge and validate their opinions by validating you.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/profile_board.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"omnisearch-bar\">Omnisearch bar</h4>\n\n<p>This is inspired by the browsers like Chrome and Firefox where the searchbar is always placed at the top so that readers can easily search for the next thing without having to go back to the main page and scroll through dozens of articles.</p>\n\n<p>And I personally like this one because, it allows me as an author/writer to quickly jump between different posts while I am reading my articles to reference in my other articles.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/search.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The searchbar is not implemented as a scrollspying widget that pins itself automatically is because I have a preference for distraction free content when reading, that is why the website provides a chevron to scroll to the top easily instead of pinning the search to the header.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"feed-like-structure\">Feed-like structure</h4>\n\n<p>I am a big fan of Aza Raskin's infinite scroll design and the fact that it provides such an easy way to engage users is just mind-blowing. That said, I must also confess that I am not a big fan of infinite scrolls on social media websites given their addictive nature. Blogs are fundamentally finite in nature. I mean even if you are a highly productive individual who writes a thousand page essay a day, you would have only written 365 essays and not all of them interesting to me. So having a feed-like structure on blogs I feel is fundamental to allowing users to engage in a more neutral way.</p>\n\n<p>And if you are still not sure of its utility, go join twitter or facebook or instagram, and comeback to read this again after a month or so.</p>\n\n<p>Untill then here is the screenshot:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/feed.png\" style=\"box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"auto-tagging-wip-posts-on-the-feed\">Auto-tagging WIP posts on the feed</h4>\n\n<p>Sometimes you are writing something interesting but have not completed the entire thing, lets say like a series of posts on single, it can be helpful to show users right away on the feed/homepage the status so that when they click the post, their expectations are already managed.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/ongoing.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #f7f7f7; box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" height=\"100%\" width=\"80%\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"clickable-tags\">Clickable tags</h4>\n\n<p>If you go the posts on the homepage, and go inside any of them and try to click on the tags such as date or category, you will see that it takes you to a page with all the posts belonging to that tag or date. Just a nifty little feature.</p>\n\n<p>And that is all! Thanks for scrolling all the way through to see all the features.

You can always tweak this template to your taste later.</p>\n\n<p>Visit the GitHub page for my template repository ([[raghuveerdotnet/jekyll-seamless::https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/jekyll-seamless]]), and fork it to your account using the Fork button:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><img src=\"/assets/img/fork_button.jpg\" style=\"box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Once the forking process is complete, you should have a fork (essentially a copy) of my template in your own GitHub account. On the GitHub page for your repository, click on the green “Clone or download” button, and copy the URL: we’ll need it for the next step.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"2-clone-your-repository-locally\">2. Clone your repository locally</h3>\n\n<p>Next, we want to download the files from your GitHub repository onto your local machine. To do this, replace <YOUR_COPIED_URL_HERE> in the command below with the URL you copied in the previous step, then execute this command:</YOUR_COPIED_URL_HERE></p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ git clone &lt;YOUR_COPIED_URL_HERE&gt; my-personal-website\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>As a reference point, this is how it looks like for me (the difference is likely just the GitHub username):</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ git clone git@github.com:raghuveerdotnet/jekyll-seamless.git my-personal-website\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Then, navigate into the directory that was just created:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ cd my-personal-website\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"3-test-out-the-site-locally\">3. Test out the site locally</h3>\n\n<p>Sweet! You now have your repository’s source code on your machine. Within the my-personal-website directory, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies like Jekyll:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ bundle\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Once that’s done, ask Jekyll to start serving the site locally:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ bundle exec jekyll serve\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Then, open up [[https://localhost:4000::https://localhost:4000]] in your browser.</p>\n\n<p>If everything’s done correctly, you should now see the home page of your Personal Jekyll Website with Enjoyment work Theme. 🎉</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that this site is only available locally (notice the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">localhost</code> part of the URL), so if we want it to be available on the Internet for everyone to enjoy, we need to deploy it to the Internet: we’ll use Netlify for that in the next step.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"4-connect-your-github-repository-to-netlify\">4. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify</h3>\n\n<p>Netlify lets you automatically deploy your personal website on to the Internet when you update your GitHub repository. To do this, we need to connect your GitHub repository to Netlify:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Log in to Netlify</li>\n  <li>Once logged in, click the “New site from Git” button</li>\n  <li>On the next page, select GitHub as the continuous deployment provider (you may need to authorize the connection, in which case, approve it)</li>\n  <li>On the next page, select your website repository from the list.</li>\n  <li>On the next page, replace the basic build settings with the following.\n    <ol>\n      <li>Type in \"jekyll build\" (without the quotes) inside the text field titled \"Build Command\".</li>\n      <li>Similarly type in \"_site/\" (without the quotes) inside the text field titled \"Publish Directory\".</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>On the next page, keep the default settings, and click on “Deploy site”.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That was easy! We’re almost done.</p>\n\n<p>Wait a couple of minutes for the initial deploy to complete.</p>\n\n<p>Once that’s done, your website should be available on the Internet via a generic Netlify URL, which you can change to a custom domain later if you’d like.</p>\n\n<p>Now the cool thing is this: whenever you push an update to your GitHub repository, Netlify will automatically deploy your updates to the Internet.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"5-start-producing-content-with-your-enjoyment-work-based-website\">5. Start producing content with your Enjoyment work based Website</h3>\n\n<p>At this point, you can start updating the files on your machine (in the my-personal-website folder) to change your jekyll seamless based website to your liking: update the copy, add some notes, tweak the layout, customize the colors, etc. Once you have something you’re happy with, push your changes to your GitHub repository with the following commands:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ git add --all\n$ git commit -m 'Update content'\n$ git push origin master\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>If that command succeeds and the rest of the tutorial was done correctly, in a couple of minutes, you should see your changes live on your Netlify website. 🚀</p>\n\n<p>And we’re done! You now have your own Enjoyment work based Personal Website .</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>If you’re curious, take a look at [[my personal jekyll seamless based website

You now have your own Enjoyment work based Personal Website .</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>If you’re curious, take a look at <a href=\"https://www.raghuveer.net\">my personal jekyll seamless based website here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This setup tutorial is inspired by <a href=\"https://maximevaillancourt.com\">Maxime Vaillancourt</a>'s Digital Garden Tutorial.</p>\n\n</div><div class=\"row\" id=\"author\">\n        <!-- <div class=\"col-xl-3 col-12\">\n            <img src=\"https://brennanbrown.ca/img/avatar.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail d-block mx-auto\"/>\n        </div> -->\n        <div class=\"col-xl-9 col-12\" id=\"author-text\">\n            <h2 class=\"text-lg-left text-center\">\n                About\n                DonGato\n            </h2>\n            <p>\n                A digital nomad.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div><!-- BACKLINKS --><!-- RELATED POSTS --><div class=\"related\" id=\"jekyll-seamless-relatedposts\">\n            <h2>Related Posts</h2>\n            <div class=\"related-wrapper\"><div class=\"related-group\">\n                            <a href=\"/posts/Introduction-to-enjoyment-work\">\n                                <p class=\"related-title\">Introduction to Enjoyment work</p>\n                                <p class=\"related-excerpt\">Enjoyment work is a highly functional jekyll-based theme that combines the best of different worlds (atleast tries to 😅).

id=\"philosophy\">Philosophy:</h2>\n\n<p>Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.</p>\n\n<p>Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters — including Setext, atx, Textile, reStructuredText, Grutatext, and EtText — the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.</p>\n\n<p>To this end, Markdown’s syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation characters, which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so as to look like what they mean. E.g., asterisks around a word actually look like <em>emphasis</em>. Markdown lists look like, well, lists. Even blockquotes look like quoted passages of text, assuming you’ve ever used email. This is intended as a quick reference and showcase.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>[[Headers::#heading]]</li>\n  <li>[[Emphasis::#emphasis]]</li>\n  <li>[[Lists::#lists]]</li>\n  <li>[[Links::#links]]</li>\n  <li>[[Images::#images]]</li>\n  <li>[[Code and Syntax Highlighting::#syntax]]</li>\n  <li>[[Math Expressions::#math]]</li>\n  <li>[[Tables::#tables]]</li>\n  <li>[[Blockquotes::#blockquotes]]</li>\n  <li>[[Inline HTML::#inline]]</li>\n  <li>[[Horizontal Rule::#hr]]</li>\n  <li>[[Line Breaks::#br]]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"headings\">Headings</h3>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div class=\"language-markdown highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"gh\"># H1</span>\n\n<span class=\"gu\">## H2</span>\n\n<span class=\"gu\">### H3</span>\n\n<span class=\"gu\">#### H4</span>\n\n<span class=\"gu\">##### H5</span>\n\n<span class=\"gu\">###### H6</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h1 id=\"h1\">H1</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"h2\">H2</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"h3\">H3</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"h4\">H4</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"h5\">H5</h5>\n\n<h6 id=\"h6\">H6</h6>\n\n<h3 id=\"emphasis\">Emphasis</h3>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div class=\"language-markdown highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ or _underscores_.\n\nStrong emphasis, aka bold, with <span class=\"gs\">**asterisks**</span> or <span class=\"gs\">**underscores**</span>.\n\nCombined emphasis with <span class=\"gs\">**asterisks and _underscores_**</span>.\n\nStrikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Emphasis, aka italics, with <em>asterisks</em> or <em>underscores</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Strong emphasis, aka bold, with <strong>asterisks</strong> or <strong>underscores</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Combined emphasis with <strong>asterisks and <em>underscores</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Strikethrough uses two tildes. <del>Scratch this.</del></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lists\">Lists</h3>\n\n<div class=\"language-markdown highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"p\">1.</span> First ordered list item\n   ...1.

However, many renderers – like Github's and Markdown Here – support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTPS headers);</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-markdown highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Inline <span class=\"sb\">`code`</span> has <span class=\"sb\">`back-ticks around`</span> it.\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Inline <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">code</code> has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">back-ticks around</code> it.</p>\n\n<p>Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks – they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.</p>\n\n<pre>\n```javascript\nvar s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";\nalert(s);\n```\n\n```python\ns = \"Python syntax highlighting\"\nprint s\n```\n\n```\nNo language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.\nBut let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.\n```\n</pre>\n\n<div class=\"language-javascript highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">s</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">JavaScript syntax highlighting</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"nx\">alert</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">s</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">s</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Python syntax highlighting\"</span>\n<span class=\"k\">print</span> <span class=\"n\">s</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.\nBut let's throw in a &lt;b&gt;tag&lt;/b&gt;.\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"math\">Math</h3>\n\n<p>You can write math expressions using the \\(LateX\\) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX\">markup language</a> between double dollar signs : <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">$$...$$</code>.

A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters — including Setext, atx, Textile, reStructuredText, Grutatext, and EtText — the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.</p>\n\n<p>To this end, Markdown’s syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation characters, which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so as to look like what they mean. E.g., asterisks around a word actually look like <em>emphasis</em>. Markdown lists look like, well, lists. Even blockquotes look like quoted passages of text, assuming you’ve ever used email. This is intended as a quick reference and showcase.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"#heading\">Headers</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#emphasis\">Emphasis</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#lists\">Lists</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#links\">Links</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#images\">Images</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#syntax\">Code and Syntax Highlighting</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#math\">Math Expressions</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#tables\">Tables</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#blockquotes\">Blockquotes</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#inline\">Inline HTML</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#hr\">Horizontal Rule</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#br\">Line Breaks</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"headings\">Headings</h3>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div class=\"language-markdown highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"gh\"># H1</span>\n\n<span class=\"gu\">## H2</span>\n\n<span class=\"gu\">### H3</span>\n\n<span class=\"gu\">#### H4</span>\n\n<span class=\"gu\">##### H5</span>\n\n<span class=\"gu\">###### H6</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h1 id=\"h1\">H1</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"h2\">H2</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"h3\">H3</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"h4\">H4</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"h5\">H5</h5>\n\n<h6 id=\"h6\">H6</h6>\n\n<h3 id=\"emphasis\">Emphasis</h3>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div class=\"language-markdown highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ or _underscores_.\n\nStrong emphasis, aka bold, with <span class=\"gs\">**asterisks**</span> or <span class=\"gs\">**underscores**</span>.\n\nCombined emphasis with <span class=\"gs\">**asterisks and _underscores_**</span>.\n\nStrikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Emphasis, aka italics, with <em>asterisks</em> or <em>underscores</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Strong emphasis, aka bold, with <strong>asterisks</strong> or <strong>underscores</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Combined emphasis with <strong>asterisks and <em>underscores</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Strikethrough uses two tildes. <del>Scratch this.</del></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lists\">Lists</h3>\n\n<div class=\"language-markdown highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"p\">1.</span> First ordered list item\n   ...1.

However, many renderers – like Github's and Markdown Here – support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTPS headers);</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-markdown highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Inline <span class=\"sb\">`code`</span> has <span class=\"sb\">`back-ticks around`</span> it.\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Inline <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">code</code> has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">back-ticks around</code> it.</p>\n\n<p>Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks – they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.</p>\n\n<pre>\n```javascript\nvar s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";\nalert(s);\n```\n\n```python\ns = \"Python syntax highlighting\"\nprint s\n```\n\n```\nNo language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.\nBut let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.\n```\n</pre>\n\n<div class=\"language-javascript highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">s</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">JavaScript syntax highlighting</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"nx\">alert</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">s</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">s</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Python syntax highlighting\"</span>\n<span class=\"k\">print</span> <span class=\"n\">s</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.\nBut let's throw in a &lt;b&gt;tag&lt;/b&gt;.\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"math\">Math</h3>\n\n<p>You can write math expressions using the \\(LateX\\) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX\">markup language</a> between double dollar signs : <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">$$...$$</code>. They can be written inline or as a single block.</p>\n\n<p>For example, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B | A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$</code> will render as:</p>\n\n\\[P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B | A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\\]\n\n<p>Please note that for a math block to be displayed correctly, it needs to be separated by an empty line, above and below. Besides, the pipe character <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">|</code> may conflict with markdown: it is recommended to use <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\\vert</code> instead.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tables\">Tables</h3>\n\n<p>Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them.

is going to be a super simple post about how to setup and use this theme for your own website.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"usage\">Usage</h2>\n\n<p class=\"boxit\">Q. What will it look like when I am done setting it up?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is what it should look (minus the exact essays ofcourse):\n<img src=\"/assets/img/end_result.jpg\" style=\"box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now without further ado, let's get started!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"setup-prerequisites\">Setup Prerequisites</h3>\n\n<p>For this tutorial, we’ll need to install a few things on your machine (you may have some of these already). Following the instructions on each website to install them.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>[[Ruby::https://www.ruby-lang.org/]]</li>\n  <li>[[RubyGems::https://rubygems.org/]]</li>\n  <li>[[Git::https://git-scm.com/downloads]]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You’ll also need to create accounts on the following services:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>[[GitHub::https://www.github.com/join]] (to store the website)</li>\n  <li>[[Netlify::https://app.netlify.com/signup]] (to serve the website so others can see)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Once you are all set with the prerequisites, we can then get to the fun part of getting it to appear on your screen. Let's get started with that.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"1-create-a-fork-of-the-template-repository\">1. Create a fork of the template repository</h3>\n\n<p>To simplify things, I provide the template showed in the image above to get started. You can always tweak this template to your taste later.</p>\n\n<p>Visit the GitHub page for my template repository ([[raghuveerdotnet/jekyll-seamless::https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/jekyll-seamless]]), and fork it to your account using the Fork button:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><img src=\"/assets/img/fork_button.jpg\" style=\"box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px 0 #ddd;\" /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Once the forking process is complete, you should have a fork (essentially a copy) of my template in your own GitHub account. On the GitHub page for your repository, click on the green “Clone or download” button, and copy the URL: we’ll need it for the next step.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"2-clone-your-repository-locally\">2. Clone your repository locally</h3>\n\n<p>Next, we want to download the files from your GitHub repository onto your local machine. To do this, replace <YOUR_COPIED_URL_HERE> in the command below with the URL you copied in the previous step, then execute this command:</YOUR_COPIED_URL_HERE></p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ git clone &lt;YOUR_COPIED_URL_HERE&gt; my-personal-website\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>As a reference point, this is how it looks like for me (the difference is likely just the GitHub username):</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ git clone git@github.com:raghuveerdotnet/jekyll-seamless.git my-personal-website\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Then, navigate into the directory that was just created:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ cd my-personal-website\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"3-test-out-the-site-locally\">3. Test out the site locally</h3>\n\n<p>Sweet! You now have your repository’s source code on your machine. Within the my-personal-website directory, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies like Jekyll:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ bundle\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Once that’s done, ask Jekyll to start serving the site locally:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ bundle exec jekyll serve\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Then, open up [[https://localhost:4000::https://localhost:4000]] in your browser.</p>\n\n<p>If everything’s done correctly, you should now see the home page of your Personal Jekyll Website with Enjoyment work Theme. 🎉</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that this site is only available locally (notice the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">localhost</code> part of the URL), so if we want it to be available on the Internet for everyone to enjoy, we need to deploy it to the Internet: we’ll use Netlify for that in the next step.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"4-connect-your-github-repository-to-netlify\">4. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify</h3>\n\n<p>Netlify lets you automatically deploy your personal website on to the Internet when you update your GitHub repository. To do this, we need to connect your GitHub repository to Netlify:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Log in to Netlify</li>\n  <li>Once logged in, click the “New site from Git” button</li>\n  <li>On the next page, select GitHub as the continuous deployment provider (you may need to authorize the connection, in which case, approve it)</li>\n  <li>On the next page, select your website repository from the list.</li>\n  <li>On the next page, replace the basic build settings with the following.\n    <ol>\n      <li>Type in \"jekyll build\" (without the quotes) inside the text field titled \"Build Command\".</li>\n      <li>Similarly type in \"_site/\" (without the quotes) inside the text field titled \"Publish Directory\".</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>On the next page, keep the default settings, and click on “Deploy site”.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That was easy! We’re almost done.</p>\n\n<p>Wait a couple of minutes for the initial deploy to complete.</p>\n\n<p>Once that’s done, your website should be available on the Internet via a generic Netlify URL, which you can change to a custom domain later if you’d like.</p>\n\n<p>Now the cool thing is this: whenever you push an update to your GitHub repository, Netlify will automatically deploy your updates to the Internet.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"5-start-producing-content-with-your-enjoyment-work-based-website\">5. Start producing content with your Enjoyment work based Website</h3>\n\n<p>At this point, you can start updating the files on your machine (in the my-personal-website folder) to change your jekyll seamless based website to your liking: update the copy, add some notes, tweak the layout, customize the colors, etc. Once you have something you’re happy with, push your changes to your GitHub repository with the following commands:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ git add --all\n$ git commit -m 'Update content'\n$ git push origin master\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>If that command succeeds and the rest of the tutorial was done correctly, in a couple of minutes, you should see your changes live on your Netlify website. 🚀</p>\n\n<p>And we’re done! You now have your own Enjoyment work based Personal Website .</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>If you’re curious, take a look at [[my personal jekyll seamless based website

You now have your own Enjoyment work based Personal Website .</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>If you’re curious, take a look at <a href=\"https://www.raghuveer.net\">my personal jekyll seamless based website here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This setup tutorial is inspired by <a href=\"https://maximevaillancourt.com\">Maxime Vaillancourt</a>'s Digital Garden Tutorial.</p>\n\n</div><div class=\"row\" id=\"author\">\n        <!-- <div class=\"col-xl-3 col-12\">\n            <img src=\"https://brennanbrown.ca/img/avatar.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail d-block mx-auto\"/>\n        </div> -->\n        <div class=\"col-xl-9 col-12\" id=\"author-text\">\n            <h2 class=\"text-lg-left text-center\">\n                About\n                DonGato\n            </h2>\n            <p>\n                A digital nomad.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div><!-- BACKLINKS --><!-- RELATED POSTS --><div class=\"related\" id=\"jekyll-seamless-relatedposts\">\n            <h2>Related Posts</h2>\n            <div class=\"related-wrapper\"><div class=\"related-group\">\n                            <a href=\"/posts/Introduction-to-enjoyment-work\">\n                                <p class=\"related-title\">Introduction to Enjoyment work</p>\n                                <p class=\"related-excerpt\">Enjoyment work is a highly functional jekyll-based theme that combines the best of different worlds (atleast tries to 😅).

Once you figure out which class to use, all you have to do is just add the class before the text you want inside a curl brace like this ​{:&lt;classnames-with-dot-prepended-to-them&gt;​}</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"8-other-implicit-features\">8. Other implicit features.</h3>\n\n<p>Features like backlinks, context menu, related posts, page preview are available by default as they are implemented using CSS and JS. So, you don't have to do anything other than write as you would normally to make use of those features.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<p>When you typeout square brackets, it can be frustrating to type out the entire file title everytime. At least it was for me, so I created a small VSCode plugin, the editor in which I write my essays to autocomplete the titles as soon as I type double squarebrackets. It has been pretty handy for me, if you are interested in using VSCode or already use it, you can find it here: [[Notecomplete::https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/scratchpad/tree/master/note-complete]]. It is pretty simple to use, all you have to do is just download the note-complete folder and copy it to .vscode directory in your OS to start using it. :)</p>\n\n<p>For setting up the theme on your

Specific classes for changing font-type, font-size, and font-weight</h3>\n\n<p>There are classes like very-small, medium-small, small, small-medium, medium, medium-large, large, very-large; that can be used to change the size of your text directly from markdown like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"sans\"><strong>Raw Syntax:</strong></p>\n\n  <div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>{:.large}\nSome text here that needs to be enlarged\n</code></pre></div>  </div>\n\n  <p><strong>Rendered Text:</strong></p>\n\n  <p class=\"large\">Some text here that needs to be enlarged</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly there are classes like sans, serif, bold, italic, oblique, bolder, etc for formatting the text.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Raw Syntax:</strong></p>\n\n  <div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>{:.medium .serif .oblique}\nSome text here that needs to be enlarged\n</code></pre></div>  </div>\n\n  <p><strong>Rendered Text:</strong></p>\n\n  <p class=\"medium serif oblique\">Some text here that needs to be enlarged</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Other common classes are .boxit that is used to wrap the text, .disable-user-select to disallow users from being able to select a particular piece of text by selecting it, etc. There are more classes like these which you can see in the file <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">style.css</code>. Once you figure out which class to use, all you have to do is just add the class before the text you want inside a curl brace like this ​{:&lt;classnames-with-dot-prepended-to-them&gt;​}</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"8-other-implicit-features\">8. Other implicit features.</h3>\n\n<p>Features like backlinks, context menu, related posts, page preview are available by default as they are implemented using CSS and JS. So, you don't have to do anything other than write as you would normally to make use of those features.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<p>When you typeout square brackets, it can be frustrating to type out the entire file title everytime. At least it was for me, so I created a small VSCode plugin, the editor in which I write my essays to autocomplete the titles as soon as I type double squarebrackets. It has been pretty handy for me, if you are interested in using VSCode or already use it, you can find it here: <a href=\"https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/scratchpad/tree/master/note-complete\">Notecomplete<sup ><i class=\"fa fa-github\"></i></sup></a>. It is pretty simple to use, all you have to do is just download the note-complete folder and copy it to .vscode directory in your OS to start using it. :)</p>\n\n<p>For setting up the theme on your website checkout <a style=\"background-color:#ffffc4;\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">How to setup Enjoyment work</a></p>\n\n</div><div class=\"row\" id=\"author\">\n        <!-- <div class=\"col-xl-3 col-12\">\n            <img src=\"https://brennanbrown.ca/img/avatar.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail d-block mx-auto\"/>\n        </div> -->\n        <div class=\"col-xl-9 col-12\" id=\"author-text\">\n            <h2 class=\"text-lg-left text-center\">\n                About\n                DonGato\n            </h2>\n            <p>\n                A digital nomad.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div><!-- BACKLINKS --><div class=\"related\" id=\"jekyll-seamless-backlinks\">\n        <h2>Linked References</h2>\n        <div class=\"related-wrapper\"><div class=\"related-group\">\n                            <a href=\"/posts/Exploring-the-features-of-enjoyment-work\">\n                                <p class=\"related-title\">Exploring the features of Enjoyment work</p>\n                                <p class=\"related-excerpt\">Introduction\n\nEssentiality is the heart of any good software, and this theme is designed to ensure that I don't add things that I won't u...</p>\n                            </a>\n                        </div></div>\n        <br/>\n    </div><!-- RELATED POSTS --><div class=\"related\" id=\"jekyll-seamless-relatedposts\">\n            <h2>Related Posts</h2>\n            <div class=\"related-wrapper\"><div class=\"related-group\">\n                            <a href=\"/posts/Introduction-to-enjoyment-work\">\n                                <p class=\"related-title\">Introduction to Enjoyment work</p>\n                                <p class=\"related-excerpt\">Enjoyment work is a highly functional jekyll-based theme that combines the best of different worlds (atleast tries to 😅).

Specific classes for changing font-type, font-size, and font-weight</h3>\n\n<p>There are classes like very-small, medium-small, small, small-medium, medium, medium-large, large, very-large; that can be used to change the size of your text directly from markdown like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"sans\"><strong>Raw Syntax:</strong></p>\n\n  <div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>{:.large}\nSome text here that needs to be enlarged\n</code></pre></div>  </div>\n\n  <p><strong>Rendered Text:</strong></p>\n\n  <p class=\"large\">Some text here that needs to be enlarged</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly there are classes like sans, serif, bold, italic, oblique, bolder, etc for formatting the text.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Raw Syntax:</strong></p>\n\n  <div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>{:.medium .serif .oblique}\nSome text here that needs to be enlarged\n</code></pre></div>  </div>\n\n  <p><strong>Rendered Text:</strong></p>\n\n  <p class=\"medium serif oblique\">Some text here that needs to be enlarged</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Other common classes are .boxit that is used to wrap the text, .disable-user-select to disallow users from being able to select a particular piece of text by selecting it, etc. There are more classes like these which you can see in the file <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">style.css</code>. Once you figure out which class to use, all you have to do is just add the class before the text you want inside a curl brace like this ​{:&lt;classnames-with-dot-prepended-to-them&gt;​}</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"8-other-implicit-features\">8. Other implicit features.</h3>\n\n<p>Features like backlinks, context menu, related posts, page preview are available by default as they are implemented using CSS and JS. So, you don't have to do anything other than write as you would normally to make use of those features.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<p>When you typeout square brackets, it can be frustrating to type out the entire file title everytime. At least it was for me, so I created a small VSCode plugin, the editor in which I write my essays to autocomplete the titles as soon as I type double squarebrackets. It has been pretty handy for me, if you are interested in using VSCode or already use it, you can find it here: [[Notecomplete::https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/scratchpad/tree/master/note-complete]]. It is pretty simple to use, all you have to do is just download the note-complete folder and copy it to .vscode directory in your OS to start using it. :)</p>\n\n<p>For setting up the theme on your

Specific classes for changing font-type, font-size, and font-weight</h3>\n\n<p>There are classes like very-small, medium-small, small, small-medium, medium, medium-large, large, very-large; that can be used to change the size of your text directly from markdown like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"sans\"><strong>Raw Syntax:</strong></p>\n\n  <div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>{:.large}\nSome text here that needs to be enlarged\n</code></pre></div>  </div>\n\n  <p><strong>Rendered Text:</strong></p>\n\n  <p class=\"large\">Some text here that needs to be enlarged</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly there are classes like sans, serif, bold, italic, oblique, bolder, etc for formatting the text.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Raw Syntax:</strong></p>\n\n  <div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>{:.medium .serif .oblique}\nSome text here that needs to be enlarged\n</code></pre></div>  </div>\n\n  <p><strong>Rendered Text:</strong></p>\n\n  <p class=\"medium serif oblique\">Some text here that needs to be enlarged</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Other common classes are .boxit that is used to wrap the text, .disable-user-select to disallow users from being able to select a particular piece of text by selecting it, etc. There are more classes like these which you can see in the file <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">style.css</code>. Once you figure out which class to use, all you have to do is just add the class before the text you want inside a curl brace like this ​{:&lt;classnames-with-dot-prepended-to-them&gt;​}</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"8-other-implicit-features\">8. Other implicit features.</h3>\n\n<p>Features like backlinks, context menu, related posts, page preview are available by default as they are implemented using CSS and JS. So, you don't have to do anything other than write as you would normally to make use of those features.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\n\n<p>When you typeout square brackets, it can be frustrating to type out the entire file title everytime. At least it was for me, so I created a small VSCode plugin, the editor in which I write my essays to autocomplete the titles as soon as I type double squarebrackets. It has been pretty handy for me, if you are interested in using VSCode or already use it, you can find it here: <a href=\"https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/scratchpad/tree/master/note-complete\">Notecomplete<sup ><i class=\"fa fa-github\"></i></sup></a>. It is pretty simple to use, all you have to do is just download the note-complete folder and copy it to .vscode directory in your OS to start using it. :)</p>\n\n<p>For setting up the theme on your website checkout <a style=\"background-color:#ffffc4;\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\">How to setup Enjoyment work</a></p>\n\n</div><div class=\"row\" id=\"author\">\n        <!-- <div class=\"col-xl-3 col-12\">\n            <img src=\"https://brennanbrown.ca/img/avatar.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail d-block mx-auto\"/>\n        </div> -->\n        <div class=\"col-xl-9 col-12\" id=\"author-text\">\n            <h2 class=\"text-lg-left text-center\">\n                About\n                DonGato\n            </h2>\n            <p>\n                A digital nomad.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div><!-- BACKLINKS --><div class=\"related\" id=\"jekyll-seamless-backlinks\">\n        <h2>Linked References</h2>\n        <div class=\"related-wrapper\"><div class=\"related-group\">\n                            <a href=\"/posts/Exploring-the-features-of-enjoyment-work\">\n                                <p class=\"related-title\">Exploring the features of Enjoyment work</p>\n                                <p class=\"related-excerpt\">Introduction\n\nEssentiality is the heart of any good software, and this theme is designed to ensure that I don't add things that I won't u...</p>\n                            </a>\n                        </div></div>\n        <br/>\n    </div><!-- RELATED POSTS --><div class=\"related\" id=\"jekyll-seamless-relatedposts\">\n            <h2>Related Posts</h2>\n            <div class=\"related-wrapper\"><div class=\"related-group\">\n                            <a href=\"/posts/Introduction-to-enjoyment-work\">\n                                <p class=\"related-title\">Introduction to Enjoyment work</p>\n                                <p class=\"related-excerpt\">Enjoyment work is a highly functional jekyll-based theme that combines the best of different worlds (atleast tries to 😅).

A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters — including Setext, atx, Textile, reStructuredText, Grutatext, and EtText — the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.</p>\n\n<p>To this end, Markdown’s syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation characters, which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so as to look like what they mean. E.g., asterisks around a word actually look like <em>emphasis</em>. Markdown lists look like, well, lists. Even blockquotes look like quoted passages of text, assuming you’ve ever used email. This is intended as a quick reference and showcase.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>[[Headers::#heading]]</li>\n  <li>[[Emphasis::#emphasis]]</li>\n  <li>[[Lists::#lists]]</li>\n  <li>[[Links::#links]]</li>\n  <li>[[Images::#images]]</li>\n  <li>[[Code and Syntax Highlighting::#syntax]]</li>\n  <li>[[Math Expressions::#math]]</li>\n  <li>[[Tables::#tables]]</li>\n  <li>[[Blockquotes::#blockquotes]]</li>\n  <li>[[Inline HTML::#inline]]</li>\n  <li>[[Horizontal Rule::#hr]]</li>\n  <li>[[Line Breaks::#br]]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"headings\">Headings</h3>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div class=\"language-markdown highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"gh\"># H1</span>\n\n<span class=\"gu\">## H2</span>\n\n<span class=\"gu\">### H3</span>\n\n<span class=\"gu\">#### H4</span>\n\n<span class=\"gu\">##### H5</span>\n\n<span class=\"gu\">###### H6</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h1 id=\"h1\">H1</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"h2\">H2</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"h3\">H3</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"h4\">H4</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"h5\">H5</h5>\n\n<h6 id=\"h6\">H6</h6>\n\n<h3 id=\"emphasis\">Emphasis</h3>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div class=\"language-markdown highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ or _underscores_.\n\nStrong emphasis, aka bold, with <span class=\"gs\">**asterisks**</span> or <span class=\"gs\">**underscores**</span>.\n\nCombined emphasis with <span class=\"gs\">**asterisks and _underscores_**</span>.\n\nStrikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Emphasis, aka italics, with <em>asterisks</em> or <em>underscores</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Strong emphasis, aka bold, with <strong>asterisks</strong> or <strong>underscores</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Combined emphasis with <strong>asterisks and <em>underscores</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Strikethrough uses two tildes. <del>Scratch this.</del></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lists\">Lists</h3>\n\n<div class=\"language-markdown highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"p\">1.</span> First ordered list item\n   ...1.

However, many renderers – like Github's and Markdown Here – support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTPS headers);</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-markdown highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Inline <span class=\"sb\">`code`</span> has <span class=\"sb\">`back-ticks around`</span> it.\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Inline <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">code</code> has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">back-ticks around</code> it.</p>\n\n<p>Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks – they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.</p>\n\n<pre>\n```javascript\nvar s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";\nalert(s);\n```\n\n```python\ns = \"Python syntax highlighting\"\nprint s\n```\n\n```\nNo language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.\nBut let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.\n```\n</pre>\n\n<div class=\"language-javascript highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">s</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">JavaScript syntax highlighting</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"nx\">alert</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">s</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">s</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Python syntax highlighting\"</span>\n<span class=\"k\">print</span> <span class=\"n\">s</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.\nBut let's throw in a &lt;b&gt;tag&lt;/b&gt;.\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"math\">Math</h3>\n\n<p>You can write math expressions using the \\(LateX\\) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX\">markup language</a> between double dollar signs : <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">$$...$$</code>. They can be written inline or as a single block.</p>\n\n<p>For example, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B | A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$</code> will render as:</p>\n\n\\[P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B | A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\\]\n\n<p>Please note that for a math block to be displayed correctly, it needs to be separated by an empty line, above and below. Besides, the pipe character <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">|</code> may conflict with markdown: it is recommended to use <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\\vert</code> instead.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tables\">Tables</h3>\n\n<p>Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email – a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-markdown highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Colons can be used to align columns.\n\n| Tables        |      Are      |   Cool |\n| ------------- | :-----------: | -----: |\n| col 3 is      | right-aligned | <span class=\"se\">\\$</span>1600 |\n| col 2 is      |   centered    |   <span class=\"se\">\\$</span>12 |\n| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    <span class=\"se\">\\$</span>1 |\n\nThere must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.\nThe outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the\nraw Markdown line up prettily.

A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters — including Setext, atx, Textile, reStructuredText, Grutatext, and EtText — the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.</p>\n\n<p>To this end, Markdown’s syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation characters, which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so as to look like what they mean. E.g., asterisks around a word actually look like <em>emphasis</em>. Markdown lists look like, well, lists. Even blockquotes look like quoted passages of text, assuming you’ve ever used email. This is intended as a quick reference and showcase.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"#heading\">Headers</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#emphasis\">Emphasis</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#lists\">Lists</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#links\">Links</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#images\">Images</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#syntax\">Code and Syntax Highlighting</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#math\">Math Expressions</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#tables\">Tables</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#blockquotes\">Blockquotes</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#inline\">Inline HTML</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#hr\">Horizontal Rule</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#br\">Line Breaks</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"headings\">Headings</h3>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div class=\"language-markdown highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"gh\"># H1</span>\n\n<span class=\"gu\">## H2</span>\n\n<span class=\"gu\">### H3</span>\n\n<span class=\"gu\">#### H4</span>\n\n<span class=\"gu\">##### H5</span>\n\n<span class=\"gu\">###### H6</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h1 id=\"h1\">H1</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"h2\">H2</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"h3\">H3</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"h4\">H4</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"h5\">H5</h5>\n\n<h6 id=\"h6\">H6</h6>\n\n<h3 id=\"emphasis\">Emphasis</h3>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div class=\"language-markdown highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ or _underscores_.\n\nStrong emphasis, aka bold, with <span class=\"gs\">**asterisks**</span> or <span class=\"gs\">**underscores**</span>.\n\nCombined emphasis with <span class=\"gs\">**asterisks and _underscores_**</span>.\n\nStrikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Emphasis, aka italics, with <em>asterisks</em> or <em>underscores</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Strong emphasis, aka bold, with <strong>asterisks</strong> or <strong>underscores</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Combined emphasis with <strong>asterisks and <em>underscores</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Strikethrough uses two tildes. <del>Scratch this.</del></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lists\">Lists</h3>\n\n<div class=\"language-markdown highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"p\">1.</span> First ordered list item\n   ...1.

However, many renderers – like Github's and Markdown Here – support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTPS headers);</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-markdown highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Inline <span class=\"sb\">`code`</span> has <span class=\"sb\">`back-ticks around`</span> it.\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Inline <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">code</code> has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">back-ticks around</code> it.</p>\n\n<p>Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks – they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.</p>\n\n<pre>\n```javascript\nvar s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";\nalert(s);\n```\n\n```python\ns = \"Python syntax highlighting\"\nprint s\n```\n\n```\nNo language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.\nBut let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.\n```\n</pre>\n\n<div class=\"language-javascript highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">s</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">JavaScript syntax highlighting</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"nx\">alert</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">s</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">s</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Python syntax highlighting\"</span>\n<span class=\"k\">print</span> <span class=\"n\">s</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.\nBut let's throw in a &lt;b&gt;tag&lt;/b&gt;.\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"math\">Math</h3>\n\n<p>You can write math expressions using the \\(LateX\\) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX\">markup language</a> between double dollar signs : <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">$$...$$</code>. They can be written inline or as a single block.</p>\n\n<p>For example, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B | A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$</code> will render as:</p>\n\n\\[P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B | A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\\]\n\n<p>Please note that for a math block to be displayed correctly, it needs to be separated by an empty line, above and below. Besides, the pipe character <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">|</code> may conflict with markdown: it is recommended to use <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\\vert</code> instead.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tables\">Tables</h3>\n\n<p>Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email – a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-markdown highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Colons can be used to align columns.\n\n| Tables        |      Are      |   Cool |\n| ------------- | :-----------: | -----: |\n| col 3 is      | right-aligned | <span class=\"se\">\\$</span>1600 |\n| col 2 is      |   centered    |   <span class=\"se\">\\$</span>12 |\n| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    <span class=\"se\">\\$</span>1 |\n\nThere must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.\nThe outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the\nraw Markdown line up prettily.
