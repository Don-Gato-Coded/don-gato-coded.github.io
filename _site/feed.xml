&lt;p&gt;The Canadian metal band played one of its heaviest songs during the network TV appearance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/spiritbox-jimmy-kimmel-soft-spine.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;w=1031&amp;amp;h=580&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; alt=&quot;spiritbox jimmy kimmel soft spine&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://consequence.net/artist/spiritbox/&quot;&gt;Spiritbox&lt;/a&gt; hit the stage at on Monday (July 7th) for a performance of their song “Soft Spine” in their late-night television debut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an introduction from guest host Anthony Anderson, the camera cut to black-and-white for the absolutely crushing rendition of the track, which hails from the Canadian metal band’s 2025 album &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://consequence.net/2024/11/spiritbox-new-album-tsunami-sea-perfect-soul/&quot;&gt;Tsunami Sea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; — one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://consequence.net/list/best-metal-albums-hard-rock-of-2025-so-far/&quot;&gt;top heavy albums of 2025 so far&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the group has plenty of melodic material that would have slotted it smoothly with the late-night format, Spiritbox boldly opted for one of their most aggro songs — a three-minute pounder with nu-metal riffs and fiery vocals from frontwoman Courtney LaPlante. Any unaware network TV viewers were certainly in for a shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance provides a nice teaser for what fans can expect on Spiritbox’s just-announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://consequence.net/2025/07/spiritbox-fall-2025-us-tour/&quot;&gt;Fall 2025 North American tour&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;For someone who says she is fighting AI bot scrapers just in her free time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://xeiaso.net/?ref=404media.co&quot;&gt;Xe Iaso&lt;/a&gt; seems to be putting up an impressive fight. Since she launched it in January, Anubis, a “program is designed to help protect the small internet from the endless storm of requests that flood in from AI companies,” has been downloaded nearly 200,000 times, and is being used by notable organizations including GNOME, the popular open-source desktop environment for Linux, FFmpeg, the open-source software project for handling video and other media, and UNESCO, the United Nations organization for educations, science, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iaso decided to develop Anubis after discovering that her own Git server was struggling with AI scrapers, bots that crawl the web hoovering up anything that can be used for the training data that power AI models. Like many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.404media.co/ai-scraping-bots-are-breaking-open-libraries-archives-and-museums/&quot;&gt;libraries, archives, and other small organizations&lt;/a&gt;, Iaso discovered her Git server was getting slammed only when it stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I wasn&apos;t able to load it in my browser. I thought, huh, that&apos;s strange,” Iaso told me on a call. “So I looked at the logs and I figured out that it&apos;s restarted about 500 times in the last two days. So I looked in the access logs and I saw that [an] Amazon [bot] was clicking on every single link.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iaso knew it was an Amazon bot because it self identified as such. She said she considered withdrawing the Git server from the open web but that because she wants to keep some of the source code hosted there open to the public, she tried to stop the Amazon bot instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I tried some things that I can’t admit in a recorded environment. None of them worked. So I had a bad idea,” she said. “I implemented some code. I put it up on GitHub in an experimental project dumping ground, and then the GNOME desktop environment started using it as a Hail Mary. And that&apos;s about when I knew that I had something on my hands.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways people and organizations are trying to stop bots at the moment. Historically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.404media.co/the-backlash-against-ai-scraping-is-real-and-measurable/&quot;&gt;robots.txt&lt;/a&gt;, a file sites could use to tell automated tools not to scrape, was a respected and sufficient norm for this purpose, but since the generative AI boom, major AI companies as well as less established companies and even individuals, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.404media.co/websites-are-blocking-the-wrong-ai-scrapers-because-ai-companies-keep-making-new-ones/&quot;&gt;often ignored it&lt;/a&gt;. CAPTCHAs, the little tests users take to prove they’re not a robot, aren’t great, Iaso said, because some AI bot scrapers have CAPTCHA solvers built in. Some developers have created “ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.404media.co/developer-creates-infinite-maze-to-trap-ai-crawlers-in/&quot;&gt;infinite mazes&lt;/a&gt; ” that send AI bot scrapers from useless link to useless link, diverting them from the actual sites humans use and wasting their time. Cloudflare, the ubiquitous internet infrastructure company, has created a similar “ &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/ai-labyrinth/?ref=404media.co&quot;&gt;AI labyrinth&lt;/a&gt; ” feature to trap bots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iaso, who said she deals with some generative AI at her day job, told me that “from what I have learned, poisoning datasets doesn&apos;t work. It makes you feel good, but it ends up using more compute than you end up saving. I don&apos;t know the polite way to say this, but if you piss in an ocean, the ocean does not turn into piss.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, Iaso thinks that it might be fun to mess with the AI bots that are trying to mess with the internet, but in many cases it’s not practical to send them on these wild goose chases because it requires resources Cloudflare might have, but small organizations and individuals don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Anubis is an uncaptcha,” Iaso explains on her &lt;a href=&quot;https://xeiaso.net/talks/2025/bsdcan-anubis/?ref=404media.co&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;. “It uses features of your browser to automate a lot of the work that a CAPTCHA would, and right now the main implementation is by having it run a bunch of cryptographic math with JavaScript to prove that you can run JavaScript in a way that can be validated on the server.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, Anubis verifies that any visitor to a site is a human using a browser as opposed to a bot. One of the ways it does this is by making the browser do a type of cryptographic math with JavaScript or other subtle checks that browsers do by default but bots have to be explicitly programmed to do. This check is invisible to the user, and most browsers since 2022 are able to complete this test. In theory, bot scrapers could pretend to be users with browsers as well, but the additional computational cost of doing so on the scale of scraping the entire internet would be huge. This way, Anubis creates a computational cost that is prohibitively expensive for AI scrapers that are hitting millions and millions of sites, but marginal for an individual user who is just using the internet like a human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anubis is free, open source, lightweight, can be self-hosted, and can be implemented almost anywhere. It also appears to be a pretty good solution for what we’ve repeatedly reported is a widespread problem across the internet, which helps explain its popularity. But Iaso is still putting a lot of work into improving it and adding features. She told me she’s working on a non cryptographic challenge so it taxes users’ CPUs less, and also thinking about a version that doesn’t require JavaScript, which some privacy-minded disable in their browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge in developing Anubis, Iaso said, is finding the balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The balance between figuring out how to block things without people being blocked, without affecting too many people with false positives,” she said. “And also making sure that the people running the bots can&apos;t figure out what pattern they&apos;re hitting, while also letting people that are caught in the web be able to figure out what pattern they&apos;re hitting, so that they can contact the organization and get help. So that&apos;s like, you know, the standard, impossible scenario.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iaso has a Patreon and is also supported by sponsors on Github who use Anubis, but she said she still doesn’t have enough financial support to develop it full time. She said that if she had the funding, she’d also hire one of the main contributors to the project. Ultimately, Anubis will always need more work because it is a never ending cat and mouse game between AI bot scrapers and the people trying to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iaso said she thinks AI companies follow her work, and that if they really want to stop her and Anubis they just need to distract her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you are working at an AI company, here&apos;s how you can sabotage Anubis development as easily and quickly as possible,” she wrote on &lt;a href=&quot;https://xeiaso.net/talks/2025/bsdcan-anubis/?ref=404media.co&quot;&gt;her site&lt;/a&gt;. “So first is quit your job, second is work for Square Enix, and third is make absolute banger stuff for &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt;. That’s how you can sabotage this the best.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>[&quot;[[Emanuel Maiberg]]&quot;]</name></author><category term="computing" /><category term="open-source" /><category term="linux" /><category term="web" /><category term="ai" /><summary type="html">Listen to the 404 Media Podcast</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Singles Soundtrack - YouTube</title><link href="https://don-gato-coded.github.io//posts/singles-soundtrack" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Singles Soundtrack - YouTube" /><published>2025-07-02T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-07-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://don-gato-coded.github.io//posts/singles-soundtrack</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://don-gato-coded.github.io//posts/singles-soundtrack">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Singles&lt;/em&gt; is often seen as a &lt;em&gt;sui generis&lt;/em&gt; rock-historical document because of its ostensible realism. Crowe’s love letter to his adopted hometown—shot on site and cast with actual locals—was composed in the moments before Seattle became a synecdoche for rock’s latest rebirth, and was rush-released to coincide with a moment that it, in turn, further fueled. Twenty-five years later, when local scenes are inextricable from their immediate online hype and a churn of thinkpieces mourn rock’s latest “death,” &lt;em&gt;Singles&lt;/em&gt; feels less like Hollywood realism and more like the conjured ghost of a dead moment. As in the early 1990s, so it is today: rock lies in wait, ready for its resurrection through some authentic commercial séance. Maybe Cornell knew best, growling on the &lt;em&gt;Singles&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack: “The snake retreats/Admits defeat/And waits for the birth ritual.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story behind husband and wife duo Alaina Moore and Patrick Riley – better known as Tennis – has been compelling from the start. Their debut was fueled by an epic sailing trip, and their second release is produced by The Black Keys&apos; Patrick Carney. We catch up with this intrepid duo when they bring their band to Morning Becomes Eclectic in the 11 o&apos;clock hour.

&lt;p&gt;“The Elderly Having Delicious Food” by Xiaoling Li (China). Overall Winner and Winner, Food for the Family supported by the Felix Project.&lt;br /&gt;
“In an early spring afternoon in Shuangliu Ancient Town, Sichuan Province, China, five elderly ladies in their eighties sit together. Wearing colorful jackets and wool hats, they happily eat the famous Sichuan snack ‘Spring rolls’. A wrap of thin homemade dough, filled with cucumber, carrot, and shredded scallions, drizzled with green mustard, Sichuan pepper, red oil, sweet sauce, and sprinkled with sesame seeds. They are “setting up a Dragon Gate formation” – an expression used in China to refer to neighbourhood friends coming together to chat, gossip, and share stories. Food makes these people happy; they enjoy a beautiful and joyful life.” (World Food Photography Awards sponsored by Bimi®)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group of women enjoying friendship, laughter, and food has won the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldfoodphotographyawards.com/&quot;&gt;2025 World Food Photography Awards&lt;/a&gt; sponsored by Bimi®. The photograph, taken by photographer Xiaoling Li in Sichuan Province, shows five elderly ladies eating some snacks and chatting, demonstrating how food brings us together. The image beat out nearly 10,000 submissions from photographers in 70 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What a perfect winning image for our times,” says Caroline Kenyon, founder of the World Food Photography Awards sponsored by Bimi®. “This beautifully framed shot captures five elderly women in Sichuan Province, reveling in good food with true friends. The joy they have in each other’s company is palpable, a powerful rebuke to those who would divide us. Color, composition, the variety of expressions while one determinedly plows on with their food—I defy anyone not to be uplifted by this photograph.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the overall winner, exceptional food photography was singled out across a wide variety of categories. From food styling to product shots to awards for innovation and phone photography, the winning images demonstrate the myriad ways that cuisine can be documented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judged by expert food photographers, chefs, restaurateurs, cookbook authors, and photo editors, the exceptional images show the true art behind this type of photography. In telling stories around food, these photographers are also telling tales of tradition, culture, and human relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These Awards showcase the power of photography in telling incredible food stories from around the world,” says Dave Samuels, brand director of Tenderstem® Bimi® Broccolini and headline sponsor of the Awards. “No matter how the world changes, food remains at the heart of our lives.

&lt;p&gt;“Delfina, A Pasta Granny” by Lizzie Mayson (UK). Winner, Claire Aho Award for Women Photographers.&lt;br /&gt;
“This is Delfina, I took her portrait as part of a bigger project documenting pasta grannies in Italy. Here, we are in the region of Lazio. On the bed is an angel hair type of pasta called Fieno di Canepina. It is technically very hard to make: Delfina rolls the pasta out, flicks a huge piece the size of the table out like a bed sheet, folds it concertina style, then slices it up finely. The best part is that she makes this huge amount then delivers it to the local church where they cook it up and feed homeless people.” (World Food Photography Awards sponsored by Bimi®)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fender has partnered with Jack White to release a fully fledged range of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guitarworld.com/gear/best-signature-guitars&quot;&gt;signature guitar&lt;/a&gt; products – including an accessible version of his wild custom TripleCaster &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guitarworld.com/features/best-telecasters-fender-guitars&quot;&gt;Telecaster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sleek TripleCaster – which positions itself as the wildest Tele that Fender currently has on its books – is joined by White’s signature Pano Verb &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guitarworld.com/features/best-guitar-amps&quot;&gt;guitar amp&lt;/a&gt;, and the TripleSonic Acoustasonic Telecaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a significant move from both Fender and the White Stripes hero, with the former taking the unusual decision to unveil its entire family of new White signature products in one go, rather than rolling the range out piece by piece across an extended period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three items to get stuck into, but the TripleCaster obviously takes the headline. It is seemingly inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guitarworld.com/news/jack-white-taking-me-back-live&quot;&gt;White’s very own Low Rider Telecaster&lt;/a&gt; – one of the wildest Teles ever created, which &lt;em&gt;Guitar World&lt;/em&gt; ’s Michael Astley-Brown &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guitarworld.com/news/jack-white-fender-low-rider-namm-2024-demo&quot;&gt;took for a spin during NAMM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a stalwart of White’s setup over the years, and features a bizarre spec sheet comprising a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guitarworld.com/gear/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-the-b-bender-a-guitarists-ultimate-secret-weapon&quot;&gt;B-Bender&lt;/a&gt;, D-Tuna, custom trio of pickups, half-scalloped fretboard, and a whole host of electronic gizmos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/H3M-91tsvEo?si=zv-F93jMZUw3vv-r&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, any signature replica would have to be significantly streamlined purely because of the finances and expertise involved in making such a wild instrument, but the TripleCaster does a valiant job of offering the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means the Piano Black-finished model offers a Jack White &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guitarworld.com/features/best-humbucker-pickups&quot;&gt;humbucker&lt;/a&gt;, JW-90 single-coil and White-voiced CuNiFe Wide-Range humbucker, as well as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guitarworld.com/features/how-bigsby-vibratos-changed-guitar&quot;&gt;Bigsby&lt;/a&gt; vibrato, a Hipshot Xtender DropTuner and a kill switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you’re not exactly getting the Low Rider, but the TripleCaster looks to be a nice middle ground between White’s wild custom model and a stripped-back signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also sets a rather tantalizing precedent. Could we see similar recreations of White&apos;s other custom Fenders – such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guitarworld.com/news/jack-white-custom-fender-jazzmaster-pitch-shifter&quot;&gt;his pitch-shifting Jazzmaster&lt;/a&gt; – down the line?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TripleCaster is joined by the TripleSonic – a Satin Black/Arctic White Acoustasonic that offers specs such as a Soft V neck shape (as opposed to the standard model’s Deep C Profile), a uniquely shaped pickguard and pickup voicings curated by White.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model also looks to be based on another guitar that has become a key player in White’s arsenal, namely the black burst Acoustasonic that he’s been spotted playing on various occasions – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guitarworld.com/news/jack-white-olympia-concert&quot;&gt;including a 2022 set in Paris&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fender’s final offering from its Jack White signature collection is the Pano Verb. A combination of White’s Vintage Vibrasonic and Vibroverb amps, the Pano Verb offers “enhanced stereo reverb and tremolo effects”, and a unique 15” / 10” speaker combo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amp itself is the result of four years of development between Fender and White, with the latter describing the Pano Verb as his vision of “the ultimate amplifier”. It is, apparently, unlike anything Fender has ever done before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all high-end products, so they’re priced accordingly. The Pano Verb and TripleCaster are available for $2,999, while the TripleSonic will have a price tag of $2,499.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We found the best of the old with the best of the new, and mixed innovation with the history of Fender, and did something we think maybe Leo Fender would be very proud of,” says White of his new collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Jack is regarded as a true visionary in the music world, and it has been an incredible journey working with him on developing these products,” adds Fender’s Justin Norvell. “This collection embodies the essence of what makes Jack White an icon, and we&apos;re proud to bring his vision to life for fans and musicians alike.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is White&apos;s first official drop with Fender, but it&apos;s by no means the first time he&apos;s worked with an outside company to produce some signature gear. Over the years, he and his Third Man Hardware brand have partnered with Donner for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guitarworld.com/reviews/third-man-hardware-x-donner-triple-threat&quot;&gt;the Triple Threat&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guitarworld.com/news/third-man-hardware-anasounds-la-grotte&quot;&gt;worked with Anasounds to produced his ideal spring reverb pedal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>[&quot;[[Guitar World]]&quot;]</name></author><category term="Music" /><category term="music" /><category term="musicians" /><category term="youtube" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
