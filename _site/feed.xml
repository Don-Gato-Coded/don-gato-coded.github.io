&lt;p&gt;The Canadian metal band played one of its heaviest songs during the network TV appearance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/spiritbox-jimmy-kimmel-soft-spine.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;w=1031&amp;amp;h=580&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; alt=&quot;spiritbox jimmy kimmel soft spine&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://consequence.net/artist/spiritbox/&quot;&gt;Spiritbox&lt;/a&gt; hit the stage at on Monday (July 7th) for a performance of their song ‚ÄúSoft Spine‚Äù in their late-night television debut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an introduction from guest host Anthony Anderson, the camera cut to black-and-white for the absolutely crushing rendition of the track, which hails from the Canadian metal band‚Äôs 2025 album &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://consequence.net/2024/11/spiritbox-new-album-tsunami-sea-perfect-soul/&quot;&gt;Tsunami Sea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äî¬†one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://consequence.net/list/best-metal-albums-hard-rock-of-2025-so-far/&quot;&gt;top heavy albums of 2025 so far&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the group has plenty of melodic material that would have slotted it smoothly with the late-night format, Spiritbox boldly opted for one of their most aggro songs ‚Äî a three-minute pounder with nu-metal riffs and fiery vocals from frontwoman Courtney LaPlante. Any unaware network TV viewers were certainly in for a shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For someone who says she is fighting AI bot scrapers just in her free time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://xeiaso.net/?ref=404media.co&quot;&gt;Xe Iaso&lt;/a&gt; seems to be putting up an impressive fight. Since she launched it in January, Anubis, a ‚Äúprogram is designed to help protect the small internet from the endless storm of requests that flood in from AI companies,‚Äù has been downloaded nearly 200,000 times, and is being used by notable organizations including GNOME, the popular open-source desktop environment for Linux, FFmpeg, the open-source software project for handling video and other media, and UNESCO, the United Nations organization for educations, science, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iaso decided to develop Anubis after discovering that her own Git server was struggling with AI scrapers, bots that crawl the web hoovering up anything that can be used for the training data that power AI models. Like many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.404media.co/ai-scraping-bots-are-breaking-open-libraries-archives-and-museums/&quot;&gt;libraries, archives, and other small organizations&lt;/a&gt;, Iaso discovered her Git server was getting slammed only when it stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI wasn&apos;t able to load it in my browser. I thought, huh, that&apos;s strange,‚Äù Iaso told me on a call. ‚ÄúSo I looked at the logs and I figured out that it&apos;s restarted about 500 times in the last two days. So I looked in the access logs and I saw that [an] Amazon [bot] was clicking on every single link.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iaso knew it was an Amazon bot because it self identified as such. She said she considered withdrawing the Git server from the open web but that because she wants to keep some of the source code hosted there open to the public, she tried to stop the Amazon bot instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI tried some things that I can‚Äôt admit in a recorded environment. None of them worked. So I had a bad idea,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI implemented some code. I put it up on GitHub in an experimental project dumping ground, and then the GNOME desktop environment started using it as a Hail Mary. And that&apos;s about when I knew that I had something on my hands.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways people and organizations are trying to stop bots at the moment. Historically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.404media.co/the-backlash-against-ai-scraping-is-real-and-measurable/&quot;&gt;robots.txt&lt;/a&gt;, a file sites could use to tell automated tools not to scrape, was a respected and sufficient norm for this purpose, but since the generative AI boom, major AI companies as well as less established companies and even individuals, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.404media.co/websites-are-blocking-the-wrong-ai-scrapers-because-ai-companies-keep-making-new-ones/&quot;&gt;often ignored it&lt;/a&gt;. CAPTCHAs, the little tests users take to prove they‚Äôre not a robot, aren‚Äôt great, Iaso said, because some AI bot scrapers have CAPTCHA solvers built in. Some developers have created ‚Äú &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.404media.co/developer-creates-infinite-maze-to-trap-ai-crawlers-in/&quot;&gt;infinite mazes&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äù that send AI bot scrapers from useless link to useless link, diverting them from the actual sites humans use and wasting their time. Cloudflare, the ubiquitous internet infrastructure company, has created a similar ‚Äú &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/ai-labyrinth/?ref=404media.co&quot;&gt;AI labyrinth&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äù feature to trap bots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iaso, who said she deals with some generative AI at her day job, told me that ‚Äúfrom what I have learned, poisoning datasets doesn&apos;t work. It makes you feel good, but it ends up using more compute than you end up saving. I don&apos;t know the polite way to say this, but if you piss in an ocean, the ocean does not turn into piss.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, Iaso thinks that it might be fun to mess with the AI bots that are trying to mess with the internet, but in many cases it‚Äôs not practical to send them on these wild goose chases because it requires resources Cloudflare might have, but small organizations and individuals don‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAnubis is an uncaptcha,‚Äù Iaso explains on her &lt;a href=&quot;https://xeiaso.net/talks/2025/bsdcan-anubis/?ref=404media.co&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;. ‚ÄúIt uses features of your browser to automate a lot of the work that a CAPTCHA would, and right now the main implementation is by having it run a bunch of cryptographic math with JavaScript to prove that you can run JavaScript in a way that can be validated on the server.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, Anubis verifies that any visitor to a site is a human using a browser as opposed to a bot. One of the ways it does this is by making the browser do a type of cryptographic math with JavaScript or other subtle checks that browsers do by default but bots have to be explicitly programmed to do. This check is invisible to the user, and most browsers since 2022 are able to complete this test. In theory, bot scrapers could pretend to be users with browsers as well, but the additional computational cost of doing so on the scale of scraping the entire internet would be huge. This way, Anubis creates a computational cost that is prohibitively expensive for AI scrapers that are hitting millions and millions of sites, but marginal for an individual user who is just using the internet like a human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anubis is free, open source, lightweight, can be self-hosted, and can be implemented almost anywhere. It also appears to be a pretty good solution for what we‚Äôve repeatedly reported is a widespread problem across the internet, which helps explain its popularity. But Iaso is still putting a lot of work into improving it and adding features. She told me she‚Äôs working on a non cryptographic challenge so it taxes users‚Äô CPUs less, and also thinking about a version that doesn‚Äôt require JavaScript, which some privacy-minded disable in their browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge in developing Anubis, Iaso said, is finding the balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe balance between figuring out how to block things without people being blocked, without affecting too many people with false positives,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd also making sure that the people running the bots can&apos;t figure out what pattern they&apos;re hitting, while also letting people that are caught in the web be able to figure out what pattern they&apos;re hitting, so that they can contact the organization and get help. So that&apos;s like, you know, the standard, impossible scenario.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iaso has a Patreon and is also supported by sponsors on Github who use Anubis, but she said she still doesn‚Äôt have enough financial support to develop it full time. She said that if she had the funding, she‚Äôd also hire one of the main contributors to the project. Ultimately, Anubis will always need more work because it is a never ending cat and mouse game between AI bot scrapers and the people trying to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iaso said she thinks AI companies follow her work, and that if they really want to stop her and Anubis they just need to distract her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIf you are working at an AI company, here&apos;s how you can sabotage Anubis development as easily and quickly as possible,‚Äù she wrote on &lt;a href=&quot;https://xeiaso.net/talks/2025/bsdcan-anubis/?ref=404media.co&quot;&gt;her site&lt;/a&gt;. ‚ÄúSo first is quit your job, second is work for Square Enix, and third is make absolute banger stuff for &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt;. That‚Äôs how you can sabotage this the best.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>[&quot;[[Emanuel Maiberg]]&quot;]</name></author><category term="computing" /><category term="open-source" /><category term="linux" /><category term="web" /><category term="ai" /><summary type="html">Listen to the 404 Media Podcast</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Singles Soundtrack - YouTube</title><link href="https://don-gato-coded.github.io//posts/singles-soundtrack" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Singles Soundtrack - YouTube" /><published>2025-07-02T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-07-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://don-gato-coded.github.io//posts/singles-soundtrack</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://don-gato-coded.github.io//posts/singles-soundtrack">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Singles&lt;/em&gt; is often seen as a &lt;em&gt;sui generis&lt;/em&gt; rock-historical document because of its ostensible realism. Crowe‚Äôs love letter to his adopted hometown‚Äîshot on site and cast with actual locals‚Äîwas composed in the moments before Seattle became a synecdoche for rock‚Äôs latest rebirth, and was rush-released to coincide with a moment that it, in turn, further fueled.

&lt;p&gt;The story behind husband and wife duo Alaina Moore and Patrick Riley ‚Äì better known as Tennis ‚Äì has been compelling from the start. Their debut was fueled by an epic sailing trip, and their second release is produced by The Black Keys&apos; Patrick Carney. We catch up with this intrepid duo when they bring their band to Morning Becomes Eclectic in the 11 o&apos;clock hour.

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe Elderly Having Delicious Food‚Äù by Xiaoling Li (China). Overall Winner and Winner, Food for the Family supported by the Felix Project.&lt;br /&gt;
‚ÄúIn an early spring afternoon in Shuangliu Ancient Town, Sichuan Province, China, five elderly ladies in their eighties sit together. Wearing colorful jackets and wool hats, they happily eat the famous Sichuan snack ‚ÄòSpring rolls‚Äô. A wrap of thin homemade dough, filled with cucumber, carrot, and shredded scallions, drizzled with green mustard, Sichuan pepper, red oil, sweet sauce, and sprinkled with sesame seeds. They are ‚Äúsetting up a Dragon Gate formation‚Äù ‚Äì an expression used in China to refer to neighbourhood friends coming together to chat, gossip, and share stories. Food makes these people happy; they enjoy a beautiful and joyful life.‚Äù (World Food Photography Awards sponsored by Bimi¬Æ)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group of women enjoying friendship, laughter, and food has won the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldfoodphotographyawards.com/&quot;&gt;2025 World Food Photography Awards&lt;/a&gt; sponsored by Bimi¬Æ. The photograph, taken by photographer Xiaoling Li in Sichuan Province, shows five elderly ladies eating some snacks and chatting, demonstrating how food brings us together. The image beat out nearly 10,000 submissions from photographers in 70 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhat a perfect winning image for our times,‚Äù says Caroline Kenyon, founder of the World Food Photography Awards sponsored by Bimi¬Æ. ‚ÄúThis beautifully framed shot captures five elderly women in Sichuan Province, reveling in good food with true friends. The joy they have in each other‚Äôs company is palpable, a powerful rebuke to those who would divide us. Color, composition, the variety of expressions while one determinedly plows on with their food‚ÄîI defy anyone not to be uplifted by this photograph.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the overall winner, exceptional food photography was singled out across a wide variety of categories. From food styling to product shots to awards for innovation and phone photography, the winning images demonstrate the myriad ways that cuisine can be documented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judged by expert food photographers, chefs, restaurateurs, cookbook authors, and photo editors, the exceptional images show the true art behind this type of photography. In telling stories around food, these photographers are also telling tales of tradition, culture, and human relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThese Awards showcase the power of photography in telling incredible food stories from around the world,‚Äù says Dave Samuels, brand director of Tenderstem¬Æ Bimi¬Æ Broccolini and headline sponsor of the Awards. ‚ÄúNo matter how the world changes, food remains at the heart of our lives. These extraordinary images serve as a reminder of the fundamental role food plays across communities; bringing people together through growing, cooking, eating, celebrating, and surviving.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

‚ÄúThis image, taken in July 2024, captures a vineyard in Oltrep√≤ Pavese, a historical region in the province of Pavia in Lombardy, Italy.

‚ÄúThis is Delfina, I took her portrait as part of a bigger project documenting pasta grannies in Italy. Here, we are in the region of Lazio. On the bed is an angel hair type of pasta called Fieno di Canepina.
